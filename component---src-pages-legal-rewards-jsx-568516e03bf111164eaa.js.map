You are automatically enrolled in the Rewards Program by opening and maintaining a Brex Account in good standing. Capitalized terms used in this Rewards Agreement have the meaning provided in Section 4 or as defined in the <a href=\\\"/legal/\\\">Platform Agreement</a>. We may update or replace this Rewards Agreement with you by posting an updated version to our <a href=\\\"/legal/\\\">legal page</a>.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"0-overview\\\">0. Overview</h2>\\n<p>This Rewards Agreement is organized into the following sections:</p>\\n<p><strong>Section 1</strong> describes the how you may accrue Points, earn Rewards, and redeem Points for Rewards or receive benefits through your Brex Account.</p>\\n<p><strong>Section 2</strong> describes the conditions that you must satisfy to continue to have access to the Rewards Program as well as other terms applicable your participation in the Rewards Program.</p>\\n<p><strong>Section 3</strong> describes a description of our and your liabilities and how disputes will be resolved, and information on how we will provide Notices to you. <strong>THIS SECTION ALSO INCLUDES YOUR WAIVER TO CONSOLIDATED OR CLASS ACTIONS AND YOUR AGREEMENT TO RESOLVE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION, SO PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>Section 4</strong> includes the capitalized, defined terms used in this Rewards Agreement.</p>\\n<p>You may only participate in the Rewards Program if you accept all of the terms and conditions of this Rewards Agreement.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"1-the-rewards-program\\\">1. The Rewards Program</h2>\\n<h3 id=\\\"1-1-accruing-points-and-earning-rewards\\\">1.1 Accruing Points and Earning Rewards</h3>\\n<p>You may accrue Points or earn Rewards under the Rewards Program through use of your Brex Account, including bona fide purchases with Cards or taking actions on your Brex Account that we specify from time to time. The specific Points you may accrue or Rewards you may earn may be different depending on the product you use. Details are provided on <a href=\\\"https://brex.com/\\\">our website</a>. Brex may determine when, how, and under what conditions you accrue Points or earn Rewards, we may change these determinations or conditions at any time and may put limits on or exclude accrual of Points in certain purchasing categories. We may also make Multipliers available for purchasing categories, and may set, change, or eliminate Multipliers at any time. Points accrual may be netted against transaction reversals (such as refunds or chargebacks) or where we determine, in our sole discretion, that the conditions required for accrual of Points were not satisfied. If this results in a negative Point balance, we may subtract a proportionate number of Points from existing Points balances or any future Points that would otherwise accrue to your Brex Account.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"1-2-redeeming-points\\\">1.2 Redeeming Points</h3>\\n<p>We display Company’s Points, redemption options, and earned Rewards in your Brex Account. You may only redeem Points through your Brex Account and the value of Rewards or Points to you will vary depending on how authorized Users elect to redeem them. We or Third-Party Service Providers may condition when and how you can redeem Points for Rewards or how you may earn Rewards. For example, a Third-Party Service Provider may limit use of a Reward for their products or services to their existing customers or require use of a Reward before a specific date.</p>\\n<p>We may limit use of Points or redemption of Rewards to specific authorized Users. Brex is not responsible for and will not police the use of Points or redemption of Rewards by Users. You are solely responsible for any actions taken by Users to use Points or redeem Rewards, even if such use violates Company’s policies or rules, industry practice, ethics, or laws applicable to your specific business.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"1-3-restricted-rewards\\\">1.3 Restricted Rewards</h3>\\n<p>Restricted Rewards may only be available to a subset of Brex customers or in limited quantities. For example, a Reward may provide specific Users the option to attend an event with a limited number of seats. Where a Restricted Reward is made available to you, your redemption options will depend on whether you satisfy the conditions required before the specific Restricted Reward is exhausted. You are not guaranteed any access to any Rewards that are limited in number or conditioned on satisfying specific requirements, even if the exact number of redemption options or requirements are not communicated to you.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"1-4-privacy\\\">1.4 Privacy</h3>\\n<p>Users may be required to provide personal information to redeem Points for Rewards, which may be provided to third parties. Users who redeem Rewards provided by Third-Party Services Providers consent to Brex providing personal information for these purposes. Please review our <a href=\\\"/privacy/\\\">privacy policy</a> and <a href=\\\"mailto:privacy@brex.com\\\">contact us</a> if you have any questions.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"2-participation-in-the-program\\\">2. Participation in the Program</h2>\\n<h3 id=\\\"2-1-requirements-for-participation-restrictions\\\">2.1 Requirements for Participation; Restrictions</h3>\\n<p>In order to participate in the Rewards Program your Brex Account must be continuously in good standing, you must maintain a Linked Account, and all Users accruing Points must be affiliated with the Company. You may be disqualified from participating in the Rewards Program if you fail to pay amounts you owe when requested by Brex, misuse Cards or Services, engage in self-dealing (such as using Cards to pay for products or Services provided by the Company or its affiliates) or other <a href=\\\"/legal/prohibited_activities/\\\">prohibited business activity</a>, breach policies or other agreements with Brex, or attempt to otherwise game or misuse the Rewards Program. Where we determine, in our sole discretion, that Company no longer satisfies the requirements for participation in the Rewards Program, we may disqualify you and you may forfeit any Points that you have earned.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"2-2-rewards-tiers\\\">2.2 Rewards Tiers</h3>\\n<p>We may establish multiple Rewards Tiers with separate criteria for participation, and with distinct benefits, such as access to Restricted Rewards or different Multipliers. While we may publicize certain requirements for participation in a Rewards Tier, we will ultimately make independent evaluations as to whether Company or a given User qualifies for a given Reward Tier. We may use any information that you make provide to Brex or that we have access to when determining qualification for a Rewards Tier and may not disclose all of the factors taken into consideration when making a determination. Please <a href=\\\"mailto:support@brex.com\\\">contact us</a> if you believe that you qualify for a specific Rewards Tier.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"2-3-points-are-not-property\\\">2.3 Points are not Property</h3>\\n<p>Points and Rewards are not the property of either the Company or any User. You will lose them if your Brex Account is closed or if Brex determines in its sole discretion that you are not entitled to them. We may void any Points or Rewards if we determine that you have violated this Rewards Agreement, the Platform Agreement, or any policy or agreement between you and Brex, or Points or Rewards were provided to you in error or in violation of our policies.</p>\\n<p>You cannot transfer Points or Rewards to any third parties or other Brex Accounts, even to a Brex Account that is has the same ownership or control, such as a subsidiary or affiliate. Attempts to transfer Points or Rewards whether by operation of law or by contract, such as a security agreement between you and a third party or through insolvency or bankruptcy, are void and you will immediately forfeit the Points or Rewards applicable to you Brex Account.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"3-additional-terms\\\">3. Additional Terms</h2>\\n<h3 id=\\\"3-1-term-and-termination\\\">3.1 Term and Termination</h3>\\n<p>This Rewards Agreement is effective when Brex approves your application and is coterminous with the Platform Agreement.
