Michael.\n        </React.Fragment>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    {\n      speaker: \"Michael T\",\n      text: (\n        <React.Fragment>\n          Yes, that&#39;s a hot topic these days. And I like to say that I did a\n          raise from SoftBank. Back in 2015. Before it was fashionable -\n          it&#39;s become very fashionable. And that was a raise actually before\n          the vision fund. So this was just when it was still kind of the\n          telecom company in Japan and they were raising funds.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          So we [at SoFi] raised a billion dollars, led by SoftBank, back in\n          2015. And it was a it was an interesting experience. I was 27, at the\n          time working at SoFi, social finance, the student loan company, as the\n          VP of Finance.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          The round started when I was in China with the CEO kind of kicking off\n          the round. And we sort of got an inquiry from SoftBank. I remember, I\n          sent a couple follow ups, I kind of just went anyway. And then all of\n          a sudden, we got this notice like, oh, please come to San Carlos,\n          where they have a US office. And we went in there, we were to meet\n          with masa, the main guy. And he was on this big screen in the room.\n          And we were... I don&#39;t remember I was kind of awkward. I\n          didn&#39;t know where to sit. Because I was the VP of finance with the\n          CEO with me. He was kind of doing the pitch and I was there with the\n          computer in case there were questions you see. And there was tea\n          because it was kinda a Japanese vibe. And I was again with my little\n          computer kind of ready to answer any questions. They didn&#39;t come\n          up. So I don&#39;t think I really talked. But we were raising about\n          200 million at the time. And then Masason was like: &#39;No,\n          you&#39;re raising a billion.&#39; And so it was kind of crazy. So we\n          came out and the CEO Mike and I were in the car on the way back. He\n          drove a Tesla. And I had my little myfi, I always have a myfi with me.\n          I don&#39;t believe in the carrier - the Wi Fi that comes from the\n          phone. It&#39;s not strong enough. So I have my own little device I\n          turned it on. I&#39;m trying to email the board - I&#39;m like how the\n          hell are we gonna get this approved? We&#39;re trying to raise 200\n          million now we&#39;re raising a billion - dilution, everything. But\n          anyway, I&#39;m, you know, sending emails, we&#39;re talking,\n          everything&#39;s going crazy. And all of a sudden, somehow we got a\n          car accident.\n        </React.Fragment>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    {\n      speaker: \"Chris R\",\n      text: <React.Fragment>And what hit the curb?</React.Fragment>,\n    },\n\n    {\n      speaker: \"Michael T\",\n      text: (\n        <React.Fragment>\n          I think Mike tried to blame me.

So we call the people they&#39;re\n          coming. And we walk across the highway to have dinner at Denny&#39;s.\n          It was walking distance\n        </React.Fragment>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    {\n      speaker: \"Chris R\",\n      text: (\n        <React.Fragment>\n          While your car is just on the side of the road?\n        </React.Fragment>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    {\n      speaker: \"Michael T\",\n      text: (\n        <React.Fragment>\n          On the side of the road. And I said to Mike at the time, I said\n          we&#39;re the only people who have ever raised a billion dollars and\n          celebrated at Denny&#39;s. So that was the story.\n        </React.Fragment>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    {\n      speaker: \"Chris R\",\n      text: (\n        <React.Fragment>\n          I think you might be the only people who have ever celebrated that\n          Denny&#39;s.\n        </React.Fragment>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    {\n      speaker: \"Michael T\",\n      text: (\n        <React.Fragment>\n          We might be. I mean, I don&#39;t know. I mean, every CEO I&#39;ve\n          worked with has very specific taste in food. I don&#39;t know if\n          that&#39;s a requirement. Maybe it&#39;s a requirement if you&#39;re\n          tall and have specific taste in food. But Mike had all these rules and\n          Henrique our CEO here [at Brex] doesn&#39;t eat vegetables and this\n          and that. So, you know, keeping up with the diet&#39;s is hard. I just\n          eat whatever sort of meal.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          But on SoftBank, I think the interesting thing that they&#39;ve done,\n          or what they do is they sort of push you as a company, almost like a\n          coach would say: no raise more, if you raise more, how much faster can\n          you grow? It&#39;s almost this idea that raising a lot of capital is a\n          moat. So you kind of build a moat around your business. Because\n          you&#39;re the first to raise so much money that other little ankle\n          biters that are trying to compete can&#39;t, because SoftBank has sort\n          of picked this winner by injecting so much cash into it. I think\n          it&#39;s largely a psychological thing. Because once you get up to\n          that scale, I mean, how much can you really execute on in 200 million,\n          versus a billion?\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          I know, it depends on the business. So if you think about it, SoFi was\n          capital intensive, and so it was kind of a moat, because it allowed\n          the refinancing of student loans, so they were allowed to incubate the\n          lending businesses on their balance sheet, whereas other startups\n          wouldn&#39;t have that ability. So I think in capital intensive\n          businesses, it&#39;s probably more than psychology, in businesses that\n          are running huge losses like for food delivery. I think [Softbank] has\n          been pretty active in doordash, although it hasn&#39;t necessarily\n          picked a winner, because you have caviar and ubereats and grubhub. So\n          this is a very competitive space. So I don&#39;t think it actually\n          worked there. I think for SoFi it did sort of work. I think it could\n          work in other - driverless is another area that&#39;s very capital\n          intensive. And they&#39;ve definitely done investments there. So it\n          does seem that softbank intends to try and pick markets where capital\n          intensity, if there such that capital injection could be a competitive\n          advantage. But I agree in the sense of like social networks, having\n          more money doesn&#39;t necessarily mean I mean, yes, you can hire more\n          talent, etc.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          But, that&#39;s not the primary thing. It&#39;s more about product and\n          usage and network effects and all the stuff that you can&#39;t just\n          throw money at.\n        </React.Fragment>\n      ),\n    },\n    {\n      speaker: \"Chris R\",\n      text: (\n        <React.Fragment>\n          So somebody who wanted to raise money from SoftBank, what would they\n          do?\n        </React.Fragment>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    {\n      speaker: \"Michael T\",\n      text: (\n        <React.Fragment>\n          Yes. So you need to know them, right. First of all, SoftBank is not in\n          the early early stage game. No. So they probably find you.\n        </React.Fragment>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    {\n      speaker: \"Chris R\",\n      text: (\n        <React.Fragment>\n          That&#39;s just too much money for them to do early stage, right?\n        </React.Fragment>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    {\n      speaker: \"Michael T\",\n      text: (\n        <React.Fragment>\n          And you invest a billion dollars, right, in $10 million checks - just\n          takes too long. So I think that they are probably going to find you\n          once you&#39;re at a specific scale. And if not, I&#39;d say that,\n          there&#39;s probably through your existing investors, they&#39;re\n          likely to have some relationship with SoftBank and their network.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          I think the thing about SoftBank is that it&#39;s definitely a\n          powerful counterparty. They&#39;re big, they can come in sometimes, if\n          they see competitive dynamics, they could potentially go fund one of\n          your competitors if you don&#39;t take their money. So kicking off\n          that conversation with SoftBank is kind of a serious thought. You want\n          to tread lightly, but I think if you are right for them, and\n          they&#39;re right for you, it can be very powerful match in an\n          interesting industry because they&#39;re willing to take extremely big\n          bets on people.\n          <br />\n          <br />I think wework is actually something we didn&#39;t talk about\n          earlier. But that&#39;s an example. Wework co-working, it&#39;s\n          capital intensive. There are a fair number of competitors. And\n          SoftBank likes to come in and pick the winner. They sort of picked\n          that winner. I think the same happened with Uber.\n        </React.Fragment>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    {\n      speaker: \"Chris R\",\n      text: (\n        <React.Fragment>\n          All right, Michael, thanks so much for talking about fundraising from\n          SoFi.\n        </React.Fragment>\n      ),\n    },\n\n    {\n      speaker: \"Michael T\",\n      text: <React.Fragment>Thank you, Chris.</React.Fragment>,\n    },\n  ],\n};\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nimport Layout from \"components/layout\";\n\nimport TranscriptHero from \"components/podcast/transcriptHero\";\nimport Transcript from \"components/podcast/transcript\";\nimport { episodeThreeTranscript as transcript } from \"components/brexInTheBlack/episodeThreeTranscript\";\n\nconst Episode = ({ location }) => (\n  <Layout\n    location={location}\n    whiteContentBackground\n    title=\"Brex In the Black | Fundraising: Raising from Softbank\"\n    description=\"Raising capital from Masayoshi Son, before it was fashionable.\"\n  >\n    <TranscriptHero\n      date={transcript.date}\n      location={transcript.location}\n      personTitle={transcript.personTitle}\n      title={transcript.title}\n    />\n    <Transcript\n      embedLink={transcript.embedLink}\n      title={transcript.title}\n      transcript={transcript.transcript}\n    />\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Episode;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
