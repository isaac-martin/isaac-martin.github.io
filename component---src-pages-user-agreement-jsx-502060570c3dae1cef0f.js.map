By using the Cards and Services available to you under a Brex Account, you consent to this User Agreement and to receive all communications from Brex electronically as described in this Agreement. We may update or replace this User Agreement with you by posting an updated version to our <a href=\\\"/legal\\\">legal page</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong> SECTION 9 ALSO INCLUDES YOUR WAIVER TO CONSOLIDATED OR CLASS ACTIONS AND YOUR AGREEMENT TO RESOLVE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION IN THE MANNER CONSENTED TO BY THE COMPANY UNDER THE <a href=\\\"/legal\\\">PLATFORM AGREEMENT</a>.

Use of Cards and Services, Statements</h2>\\n<p>Prior to using Cards on behalf of a Company, you will need an Administrator to add you as an authorized User and provide you access to the Brex Account. As a User on a Brex Account, you are required to provide information about yourself—including your name, your email address, and your phone number—as well as create login credentials. We may also ask you to provide information that we may use to verify your identity, as well as additional information that we may require to permit you to use or continue to use Cards or Services.</p>\\n<p>You may only use Cards and Services for bona fide business purposes, such as making purchases on behalf of Company; you are prohibited from using Cards or Services for personal, household, or any other purpose unrelated to Company’s business. You are also prohibited from using Cards for the benefit of any individual, organization, or country where it is prohibited by US law or whose activities are identified on our <a href=\\\"/legal/prohibited_activities\\\">Prohibited Activities List</a> that we may update from time to time.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"2-securing-and-monitoring-your-cards\\\">2. Securing and Monitoring your Cards</h2>\\n<p>You will keep Cards and your login credentials secure and will immediately notify your Administrator or Brex if you know or believe Cards or your login credentials have been compromised or stolen or may be misused. We may suspend your access to Services or Cards if we believe your Card or login credentials have been compromised, or if not doing so poses a risk to you, Company, Brex, or any third parties.</p>\\n<p>You will review the Periodic Statement associated with your Cards on no less than a monthly basis and promptly report any unauthorized or fraudulent activity to your Administrator or Brex.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"3-communicating-with-you-text-and-mobile-messages\\\">3. Communicating with You, Text and Mobile Messages</h2>\\n<p>Company has an established business relationship with Brex. You will receive Notices to the email and mobile numbers provided to Brex by you or Company. These Notices may include text or SMS messages providing information or alerts about Services, Cards, or transactions, and may allow you to provide information back to Brex (such as sending a receipt from a transaction). You may elect to not receive certain Notices through the Brex Account, but this will limit the use of certain Services and may increase the financial risks to the Company.</p>\\n<p>You are required to maintain an updated web browser and computer and mobile device operating systems to receive Notices correctly. You are responsible for all costs imposed by internet or mobile service providers for sending or receiving Notices electronically.</p>\\n<p>You consent to receiving Notices electronically to your mobile device and understand that this consent has the same legal effect as a physical signature. If you wish to revoke this consent, please notify your Administrator and <a href=\\\"mailto:support@brex.com\\\">contact us</a>.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"4-ownership-of-brex-property-feedback\\\">4.
