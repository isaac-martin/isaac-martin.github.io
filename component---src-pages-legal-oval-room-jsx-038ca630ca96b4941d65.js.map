In this Use Policy, <strong>&quot;we&quot;</strong>, <strong>&quot;our&quot;</strong>, and <strong>&quot;us&quot;</strong> refers to Brex Inc. and <strong>&quot;you&quot;</strong> refers to the Member permitted to visit or book time in the Brex Oval Room. If you have any questions, please let the lounge concierge know or <a href=\\\"mailto:ovalroom@brex.com\\\">email us</a>.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"1-eligibility-and-access\\\">1. Eligibility and Access</h2>\\n<p>The Brex Oval Room provides Members a place to connect, meet, and engage with other Members whether one-on-one or through planned events. Only invited Members and, where permitted, their guests are allowed in the space.</p>\\n<p>Brex Oval Room access will be restricted to specific days and hours as publicized on the <a href=\\\"https://brex.com/\\\">Brex site</a> or specified in email communications to Members and may require reservations in advance of visiting (<strong>&quot;Permitted Hours&quot;</strong>). Permitted Hours will depend on both availability and special events. Please make sure to verify Permitted Hours before visiting the Brex Oval Room.</p>\\n<p>We may change or establish new eligibility criteria for accessing the Brex Oval Room at any time by updating these terms or otherwise notifying you.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"2-use-and-conduct\\\">2. Use and Conduct</h2>\\n<p>Members and their permitted guests must conduct themselves professionally and respectfully, and in a manner that does not disrupt the reasonable enjoyment of others. For example, a Member should not be unreasonably loud (such as yelling or talking loudly on their phones), excessively fragrant, or messy (such as leaving personal items scattered on tables) when in the Brex Oval Room. If Brex staff believe your behavior may disrupt other Members, you will be asked to leave and, if so asked, you agree to do so promptly.</p>\\n<p>The Brex Oval Room is not a coworking space but is designed to be a place for Members to conduct business, congregate for planned events, and engage with other Members or guests. It may not be used as a substitute for an office, even temporarily. Members are welcome to complete short tasks (such as quickly sending emails or putting final touches on a presentation) but should not use the Brex Oval Room as a work place unless it has been designated as such in conjunction with Brex (such as a planned private event or offsite).</p>\\n<p>Brex does not permit any hateful, discriminatory, harassing, or otherwise offensive behavior by Members or guests in the Brex Oval Room. This includes comments or actions directed at a person’s age, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, or any other protected class.</p>\\n<p>Any Members or guests violating this Use Policy, specifically this section 2, will be asked to leave and may be prohibited from visiting the Brex Oval Room in the future.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"3-privacy-and-confidentiality\\\">3. Privacy and Confidentiality</h2>\\n<p>Members and their guests have a right to privacy. While in the Brex Oval Room, you may see or hear people or conversations incidentally. We expect that Members and their guests will use discretion and tact, and not violate the privacy rights of others. This includes but is not limited to taking pictures or recording others without their express consent.</p>\\n<p>Brex’s use of personal information provided as part of a Member or guest’s access to the Brex Oval Room is subject to the Brex Privacy Policy.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"4-reservations-and-special-events\\\">4. Reservations and Special Events</h2>\\n<p>Brex may require that Members have a reservation to access the Brex Oval Room or certain spaces within the Brex Oval Room. Special events may also have limited capacity or access and require reservations. Brex will determine, in its sole discretion, who reservations or special events will be made available to.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"5-defined-terms\\\">5. Defined Terms</h2>\\n<p>Capitalized terms used in this Use Policy are defined below. Any capitalized terms used but not defined have the meaning defined in the <a href=\\\"/legal/\\\">Brex Platform Agreement</a>:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><p><strong>Brex Oval Room</strong> means the private event and working space maintained by Brex in South Park, San Francisco.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong>Member</strong> means a User for a Company in good standing who has been approved by Brex to access the Brex Oval Room on a one-time or ongoing basis.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n\";","import React from \"react\";\n\nimport content from \"data/LoungeUsePolicy_VC190218.md\";\nimport LegalBoilerplate from \"components/LegalBoilerplate.jsx\";\nimport Layout from \"components/layout\";\n\nconst OvalRoomUsePolicy = ({ location }) => (\n  <Layout\n    location={location}\n    title=\"Brex Oval Room Use Policy | Legal | Brex\"\n    description=\"Legal information from Brex Inc.
