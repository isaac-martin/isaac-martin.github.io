Kruze offers early-stage, funded companies everything from basic monthly bookkeeping to outsourced CFO help to startup tax returns.\n\nKruze is a 2018 and 2019 Inc 5000 fastest-growing private company, and one of the SF Business Times 2019 Top 100 Women-Owned Companies in the Bay Area.","bodyChallenge":"Kruze’s clients have raised over $3 billion in venture funding, and Kruze often begins working with companies after they raise their first seed round. Kruze’s most successful clients often quickly raise multiple rounds of financing, quickly growing their revenues—and expenses.\n\nHowever, since traditional banks determine credit limits from the founder’s FICO score—rather than the company’s cash balance—high growth companies that spend heavily on advertising and servers often hit their monthly limits frequently. *“Before switching to Brex, some of our clients were blowing through their credit limits in two days,”* said Healy Jones, Vice President of FP&A at Kruze Consulting. \n\nBanks also require a personal guarantee for startups, Jones points out, *“which matters to founders quite a bit; failing fast is a lot less fun when you’re personally stuck with a $100,000 credit card bill.”*","bodyQuoteAfterChallengeSection":"“Before switching to Brex, some of our clients were blowing through their credit limits in two days.

He helps clients manage their budgets and curb their burn rates. *“Brex does not require a personal guarantee, gives startups 10-20x higher limits than traditional banks, and offers built-in tools to help executives manage team spend,”* he says. \n\nKruze uses the Brex dashboard to identify where clients are inadvertently wasting money. Using the filters, Kruze can see there could be 20 different people ordering food—across DoorDash, Caviar, Costco—or that clients have a drawer full of Apple mice going unused. \n\n*“Brex brought discipline to wasteful, uncoordinated spending, and Kruze’s data shows that Brex’s expense controls help save our clients meaningful amounts of money,”* says Jones. *“Amex doesn’t offer any tool or dashboard functionality like this.”*\n\nKruze also uses Brex’s direct [integration with QuickBooks](https://brex.com/integrations/quickbooks/?ref_code=kruzecasestudy) to close their clients’ books, which cuts out manual work and makes the monthly close process more efficient. *“If there’s an API or way to automate a process, we’ll use it, since it eliminates the risk of human error and saves time,*” says Alex Janeck, Director of Onboarding & Sales Operations. *“Brex’s best-in-class QuickBooks integration helps us close our clients’ books faster through the use of custom transaction categorization rules and intelligent category mapping.”*\n\nBrex’s support is fast and reliable. The average wait time is 30 seconds for phone calls, 60 seconds for website chat, and 1 hour for email. *“Brex customer support is superior to Amex’s,”* says Jones, *“and it gives our clients comfort to know that the response will be super quick.” *","bodyQuoteAfterSolution":"“Brex customer support is superior to Amex’s, and it gives our clients comfort to know that the response will be super quick.”","bodyImpact":"Kruze has saved their clients who use Brex over $250 per employee per month on travel, entertainment, and meals. *“That’s savings that substantially help decrease a company’s burn rate,” *said Jones.\n\n*“We’re encouraging all of our clients get on Brex,”* added Janeck. *“We assist with a lot of tax compliance work on behalf of our Clients, and using a Brex card creates a more secure way to help us do startup tax filings and make those payments for our clients—versus the traditional way of securing client banking data.”*","bodyQuoteAfterImpact":"Kruze has saved their clients who use Brex over $250 per employee per month on travel, entertainment, and meals.","refCode":"kruzecasestudy"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"4wktpwxvwf0o"}},"id":"5NeNn0siWUrEAtxaInZNfo","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-01-24T22:14:06.762Z","updatedAt":"2020-02-26T16:11:15.112Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"customerCaseStudy"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"urlPath":"carta","thumbnailImage":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"4wktpwxvwf0o"}},"id":"29cq4AHz240oMAiV6r6S1c","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2020-01-24T22:01:54.977Z","updatedAt":"2020-01-24T22:01:54.977Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"carta thumbnail","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/4wktpwxvwf0o/29cq4AHz240oMAiV6r6S1c/9dbb58799eb880fe84cc5ae25edadd88/Group_94__1_.png","details":{"size":192758,"image":{"width":1440,"height":450}},"fileName":"Group 94 (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"metaTitle":"Carta & Brex | Brex Customers","metaDescription":"Carta was hiring new employees at an incredible rate, leading to software needs, office equipment purchases, and general T&E were getting more complex.

But like many startups, Propel America didn’t have a credit score required by many traditional corporate card providers to get access to a credit card. Propel America Chief Operating Officer Debra Kurshan didn’t want any member of the team to have to provide a personal guarantee to get access to a card. \n\n“As a startup, to get a credit card, it’s challenging if you don’t have a credit history,” Kurshan said. “We didn’t want to have anyone put their personal credit on the line. When we looked at Brex, it seemed like an excellent option for us, and we applied.”\n\nPropel America has plenty of marketing costs—like printing out brochures and running conferences—and wanted to put those expenses on a credit card, but didn’t have one. The alternative was to have staff cover the expenses and get reimbursed or use a less-secure debit card. Even with a healthy cash balance and predictable expenses, Propel America faced an uphill battle to get a card.","bodySolution":"Using modern underwriting technology, Brex was able to provide Propel America with a corporate credit card without a personal guarantee.\n\nBrex bases its credit limits on a company’s cash balance, rather than a credit score, enabling many nonprofits like Propel America to move their expenses onto a corporate card. Brex’s advanced expense management tools and integrations with software like [QuickBooks](https://brex.com/integrations/quickbooks/)and[Expensify](https://brex.com/integrations/expensify/) help Propel America seamlessly monitor and report their spending.","bodyQuoteAfterSolution":"“We had a lot of money in the bank, but that wasn’t going to help us get a traditional card.”","bodyOutcome":"Kurshan no longer has to worry about one of Propel America’s founders carrying a personal guarantee for a corporate card. Now two years old, Propel America can move its marketing spend—like promotional flyers, running conferences, and teacher trainings—over to a more secure corporate card that’s easier to manage.\n\nBrex’s admin tools and controls also make it easier for Kurshan to monitor card usage and track expenses. Propel America can provide its team with multiple cards while making it easy for Kurshan to monitor spending in one central location. Nonprofits need to be able to appropriately and correctly categorize expenses, especially as they start receiving state and federal funding.\n\n“It’s been a seamless process, and the payment statements and reporting tools are really easy to use,” Kurshan said.","bodyQuoteAfterOutcome":"“As the admin, I’m able to manage them all centrally and see what’s happening on spending.

New Harvest charged anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 a year on a debit card instead of a credit card—and were missing out on rewards in the process. Brex also gives New Harvest access to a seamless interface that makes it easier to [manage and monitor expenses](https://brex.com/solution/expense-management/). That convenience is critical for nonprofits that operate with a small team on a lean budget.\n\n“The interface is really straightforward, the dashboard makes sense, and it’s rather intuitive,” said Lanto Hariveloniaina, operations manager at New Harvest.","bodyQuoteAfterSolution":"“Our Brex card ties really well with what we’re able to use in terms of integrations, like QuickBooks.”","bodyImpact":"In addition to getting a corporate card, that visibility also made it easier to help the team understand how to spend within the scope of nonprofit requirements.

Tools like instant receipt capture also helped remove a lot of headaches for the finance team. \n“They understand the fundamental functions for a corporate credit card, and what needs to work, and they do it really well,” John Pattison,  New Harvest Treasurer said.

Their projects are global, and their funding model is very straightforward. Every one dollar donated plants one tree. The aim is to make it easy and enjoyable to take action for sustainability, which is also why they emphasize positive stories over gloomy climate news in their communications.","bodyChallenge":"Like many international entrepreneurs, Matt Hill wanted to get a corporate credit card for this unique nonprofit but didn’t have a credit score in the U.S. One Tree Planted has lots of expenses to carry out the important work they do, including things like marketing and advertising, traveling around the world to document newly-planted trees, and using various online tools. All of this helps them tell stories and update donors on the impact their trees are having in the real world.\n\nFor a long time, Hill and his employees had to put all of this spending on personal cards and debit cards. That meant he wasn’t accruing rewards for spending, and he was incurring personal risk for every purchase, like renting a car for business travel.  \n\n“I managed to build a business based on a cash flow, and it fortunately worked out,” Hill said.  “But that’s a big risk, and an even bigger inconvenience for most business owners.”","bodySolution":"Brex was able to provide One Tree Planted with a corporate card by using its modern underwriting technology to provide a credit limit based on a cash balance in the bank. Hill was able to quickly set up an account after applying online and talking to a Brex account executive. He was approved within a day and could start issuing virtual corporate cards right away.   \n\nHill no longer had to put all those expenses on debit cards and personal cards—and he no longer had to deal with reimbursing employees, either. \n“Even as a successful nonprofit, it was a challenge to get approved for a card and earn reward points,” he said. “But now it’s much smoother with Brex. \n\nWe can spend on our travel and marketing as needed, and the points and monitoring features are great.”","bodyQuoteAfterSolution":"“I kept applying to the bank to get a company credit card, but was always denied because I’m Canadian. I knew there had to be a solution out there.”","bodyOutcome":"Hill no longer has to worry about leaving money on the table when he’s using a debit card or a personal card instead of a [corporate card with rewards](https://brex.com/product/corporate-card/). In addition, Brex’s interface makes it easier to monitor employee spending and ensure that donors’ money is being put to good use. \n\n“You have to be conscious and spend it wisely and prudently,” Hill said. “Now we can rest assured knowing the accounting is organized and transparent.”  \n\nHill can also now easily issue cards to the employees who need it most—the ones traveling around the world documenting those stories, and the ones handling marketing. Marketing, too, is an important use of donors’ funds as it helps drive interest and get more people excited about supporting the environment. And at the end of the day, it’s most important that people feel great about the journey of their tree.  \n\nOne Tree Planted’s project managers have to travel to potential planting sites all around the world and vet them, as well as follow up later to ensure their planting projects are successful.

In 2019, NetSuite recognized Countsy as *BPO Partner of the Year*.","bodyChallenge":"A number of Countsy’s clients use the [Brex corporate credit card](https://brex.com/product/corporate-card/) and the Oracle NetSuite ERP. In Summer 2019, when Brex launched the first-ever direct credit card [integration with NetSuite](https://brex.com/integrations/netsuite/), Countsy was an early adopter. “Typically, clients have anywhere from 2-20 cards issued to employees,” said Colman Edwards, Director of Technology at Countsy. \n“To close their books, we need to pull the transaction data into our credit card workbook, code the transactions, follow up on missing receipts, and then upload the CSV into NetSuite. We have a good process, but it’s manual.” \n","bodySolution":"Countsy started using the NetSuite integration for their Brex clients to close their books. “The integration setup is really fast—you simply install the bundle, connect it to NetSuite, assign the settings in Brex to the NetSuite accounts, then you’re up and running,” Edwards remarked. “The whole process took us 20-30 minutes per client.”","bodyQuoteAfterSolution":"\"It cuts the close time down by 4 hours. ","bodyOutcome":"The integration reduced Countsy’s manual workload. “With Brex, we no longer need to use CSVs. All the work is done within Brex and then directly imported into NetSuite,” said Edwards. “It cuts the close time down by 4 hours.”\nBecause Countsy serves a variety of clients, they needed a high degree of customization to control how the data should appear: “We like having the option to upload every individual transaction, or upload monthly batches. Individual journal entries for individual transactions are great for clients who like to do reconciliations within NetSuite.”\n          \n\nCountsy uses the integration’s flexible Custom Rules engine to set their clients’ unique business logic to automatically map to NetSuite—instead of using multiple formulas in a CSV. “Every time you export transactions, the rules are applied. You can assign people to departments, merchants to the correct categories and departments, etc.” \n         \n\nWhat Edwards appreciates most is the time it will save each month: “In the future, if people swipe their card again, the transaction is auto coded. Without custom rules, it’s 100% figuring out the coding per transaction.”\nCountsy also noticed that clients using Brex cards have receipts uploaded more often than clients not using Brex. Edwards attributes this to how easy it is to upload receipts. When employees swipe their card somewhere, Brex prompts them for a receipt via text or mobile app push. Employees can reply with a photograph and Brex auto-matches it to the transaction. “Brex giving employees the option to add receipts makes it a lot easier to close the books than with other cards,” said Edwards.","bodyQuoteAfterOutcome":"“Brex giving employees the option to add receipts makes it a lot easier to close the books than with other cards.”","refCode":"countsy"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"4wktpwxvwf0o"}},"id":"KFaELx0weLk4olvzowtq5","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-08T22:06:38.855Z","updatedAt":"2020-03-02T11:16:22.840Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"customerCaseStudy"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"urlPath":"othram","thumbnailImage":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"4wktpwxvwf0o"}},"id":"p7PrMDLYZmEhlWyjQjIg0","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2019-10-08T16:55:58.935Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-08T16:57:43.168Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Othram","description":"othram brex customers","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/4wktpwxvwf0o/p7PrMDLYZmEhlWyjQjIg0/946d937bc614be956abc5d2dee5f3be3/image__2___1___1_.png","details":{"size":299185,"image":{"width":1440,"height":450}},"fileName":"image (2) (1) (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"metaTitle":"Othram & Brex | Brex Customers  ","metaDescription":"With Brex, Othram has started streamlining expense management and reconciling in half the time.","companyLogo":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"4wktpwxvwf0o"}},"id":"5GtiOxkOmbdrX1ZolHgwD1","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2019-10-08T16:52:47.611Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-08T16:52:47.611Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Othram Brex","description":"Othram logo\n","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/4wktpwxvwf0o/5GtiOxkOmbdrX1ZolHgwD1/410ab1d07dfe27b5f2f941a5a3515895/Layer_3__2_.png","details":{"size":3099,"image":{"width":288,"height":77}},"fileName":"Layer 3 (2).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"companyLogoHeight":77,"companyLogoWidth":288,"heroBackgroundImage":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"4wktpwxvwf0o"}},"id":"p7PrMDLYZmEhlWyjQjIg0","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2019-10-08T16:55:58.935Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-08T16:57:43.168Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Othram","description":"othram brex customers","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/4wktpwxvwf0o/p7PrMDLYZmEhlWyjQjIg0/946d937bc614be956abc5d2dee5f3be3/image__2___1___1_.png","details":{"size":299185,"image":{"width":1440,"height":450}},"fileName":"image (2) (1) (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"customerCategory":"Life sciences","caseStudyTitle":"Streamlining expense management & reconciling in half the time","applicationApprovalTime":"5 minutes","implementationTime":"Immediate","painPoints":["Banks","credit limits"],"topSpendCategories":["Lab supplies","reagents"],"founders":["David Mittleman"],"yearFounded":"2018","headquarters":"Houston, TX","employeeCount":"11-50","funding":"$4M (Series A)","bodyCompany":"Othram uses DNA sequencing and genomics to advance biometrics and human identification.","bodyChallenge":"Othram’s lab operates by making bulk purchases, and Othram kept hitting the limit of their Chase bank card.

And even getting a card required a collateral deposit, which we really didn’t like.”","bodySolution":"As he was in the searching mode, Manuel decided to actually take a cold sales email seriously — this one from Brex. “Usually I don’t even look at cold emails, but I was thinking about how we could get a better process in place, and Brex looked like it might really help.”\n\nAfter giving the card a try for a few weeks, Manuel rolled the program out to his team. Overnight, he started hearing how pleased they were.\n\nNow Manuel spends less of his time chasing his employees for receipts, including the many scientists who prefer to spend their time on R&D.

We want to be efficient, but with the right levels of admin control and reporting in place,” said Mark Nasiff, Lookout’s CFO. “There wasn’t an obvious service in the market that covered all of our needs out of the box.”\n\nMark and his team wanted to avoid the overhead of implementing multiple card programs and searched for a single service to consolidate procurement and T&E expenses. “Procurement is tricky because that’s where most of the big ticket spend—like sales, advertising, and SaaS—is centered. Then there is travel and entertainment that has more focus on policy adherence and scalability.
