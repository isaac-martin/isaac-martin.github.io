","bodySolution":"Summer is busy season. It was critical for Andie Swim to access the capital they needed to accommodate demand. \"We discovered the Brex card for ecommerce just before our busy summer selling season. Being able to access a line of credit [8x - 10x higher](https://brex.com/solution/high-spending-limits/) than anything else available on the market couldn't have come at a better time.\"\n\nThe net 60 day terms, zero interest, and no additional fees was helpful for managing cash flow, seasonality, inventory, as well as paying for advertising. \"The 60 day float gives us more than enough time to make a return on any ad spend that we were using Brex to finance,” said Travis.","bodyQuoteAfterSolution":"Andie was able to access a line of credit 8-10x higher than anything else available on the market.","bodyOutcome":"Access to a higher credit limit enabled Andie to scale sales. \"Before Brex, we knew that we could generate an attractive return on our ad and inventory investments; we just didn't have access to capital to make those investments,” Travis explained. “Brex not only gave us access to the capital we needed, but also it gave us peace of mind knowing we were making those investments at the lowest possible cost of capital.\"\n\nBrex is committed to helping ambitious companies grow. \"Brex has been integral to the growth of Andie. It’s a partner that's literally scaled with us, extending us the credit we needed to meet our goals while drastically improving our capital efficiency.\"","bodyQuoteAfterOutcome":"Brex has been integral to the growth of Andie.
