","bodyQuoteAfterChallengeSection":"“We wanted a card that was tailored to companies like ours, easy to set up, included receipt management, integrated with our ERP, and had payment terms that worked for us.” \n— Madhusudan Kagwad, Cofounder and President","bodySolution":"Once the team at BureauOne decided to switch to Brex, the process was very quick. They applied, got cards right away, and immediately started issuing cards to the founders and finance team. \n\nBureauOne found Brex’s receipt capture one of the most helpful features for their company. Cardholders can simply text a picture of a receipt, or upload it to the mobile app, and Brex will automatically match it to the corresponding expense. For Kagwad, it’s great to see how the new card was saving time across the board. ","bodyQuoteAfterSolution":"“Brex makes everyone’s life easier.
