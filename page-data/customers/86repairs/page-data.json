She received her Brex [virtual card](https://brex.com/solution/virtual-card/) immediately. “It completely transformed my experience with corporate cards,” Upton said. “This was the first time I was able to get up and running right away and didn’t need to wait for the mail to arrive.”\n\nUpton uses her Brex card for all marketing purchases, like paid ads, subscriptions, events, and collateral; the sales team uses it for travel and client entertainment. “It’s a small thing, but it’s really nice not to have to go to my purse and get my wallet every time I need to make a company purchase.” \n\nBrex makes it easy to see everything in one place: “At the end of the quarter I have a comprehensive look at all spend, and it’s really easy to review transactions,” said Upton. “Brex provides an easier way to manage my budget, and it’s so helpful not to have to filter through reimbursements and expenses in CRM to check spend.”","bodyQuoteAfterSolution":"\"Brex's QuickBooks integration allows us to close our books faster and stop chasing employees around for receipts.

Brex easily saves our team 8 hours per month. It’s not pulling us away from our work.”\n\nBrex reduces the burden on employees to submit expenses, as well as for the finance team to process them: “If employees have to submit personal receipts for reimbursement, that’s more time our finance team spends to issue payment and sync to QuickBooks. It takes them away from business they should be focusing on,” says Upton.\n\n“The receipt capture makes our accounting team super happy and employees aren't hassled with finding receipts weeks later,” says Gallagher. \"[Brex’s QuickBooks integration](https://brex.com/integrations/quickbooks/) allows us to close our books faster and stop chasing employees around for receipts. The card helps us build business credit.”\n\nWhat was once a tedious process is now streamlined into everyday operations for 86 Repairs: “Managing corporate cards and logging expenses used to be so painful, and Brex has completely turned that process on its head,” says Gallagher. “It’s very intuitive and works exactly as you’d want it to.”","bodyQuoteAfterOutcome":"\"Brex easily saves our team 8 hours per month.
