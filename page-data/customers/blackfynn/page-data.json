It was already attracting attention and investments, including prestigious grants from the National Institute of Health, due to its method of bringing deep data science expertise to the field of therapeutics development.\n\n“When I arrived, we were using a PayPal debit card. As you can imagine, that wasn’t going to cut it. As a startup, it’s hard to get cards from other providers like Amex. I wasn’t sure what to do, but knew we needed an upgrade right away.”\n\nDmitriy started searching for a better card program that would facilitate clean, easy purchasing processes for his team.","bodySolution":"Dmitriy read about Brex on TechCrunch and signed up right away. \n\n“I wasn’t sure because it was so new, but we were approved in under 10 minutes and that was a really good sign. For me, the value of Brex is that we’re a startup and it’s hard to get a card. Brex fills that niche with a generous credit limit. It’s been great for a company with our needs, and I know it’s going to keep getting better faster than any other card program would.”","bodyQuoteAfterSolution":"“For me, the value of Brex is that we’re a startup and it’s hard to get a card.

It’s been great for a company with our needs, and I know it’s going to keep getting better and faster than any other card program would.”","bodyOutcome":"Blackfynn’s team runs procurement through a dedicated virtual purchasing card. It also manages T&E cards for seven managers through Brex’s [Expensify integration](https://brex.com/integrations/expensify/). The combination of rewards value, spending visibility, and custom per-card limits made Brex the clear choice for the growing company."}}}}
