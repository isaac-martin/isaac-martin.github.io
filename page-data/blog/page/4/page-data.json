While great in theory, it is important to consider that LLCs are not particularly scalable. Pass through taxation makes sense for people who have large ownership stakes in the LLC (i.e. founders and early investors), but as you add investors and employees with smaller ownership stakes, it is impractical (and often impossible) for them to have the profits and losses of your LLC passed through to them. For example, imagine you have an employee who owns a small percentage of the company and the company makes a profit for the year.
