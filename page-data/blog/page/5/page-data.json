The stakes are now dramatically higher when you're moving many billions of dollars of others’ money from point A to point B, and it requires a combination of agility and carefully-thought-out plans. Raising money on the east coast wasn't a simple task, either. Plastiq, based in Boston, had to deal with a long series of \"no\"s from investors looking for hard evidence that the products were working. Out in Silicon Valley, investors will often take a bet on the team and the idea.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Eventually, Ryan Moore of Accomplice—a successful early stage fund in Boston—took an early bet on Buchanan and the rest of the team. Eventually, they ended up moving out to the Bay Area for all the reasons you might expect for a technology startup: talent, resources, and of course, more money. But that also came with the challenges of uprooting an entire company and juggling a whole array of different cliques and cultures. Getting everyone on the same page is one of a startup's biggest challenges, and these days Buchanan tries to be as transparent as possible with the team.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"\"You can often oversell, and you can get good at that,\" he said. \"Some of the hires who were probably the weakest fits have been actually really strong individuals and great people.

Then, like many successful startups, Plastiq started doubling down on specific use cases. It's a strategy that works because it allows you to first figure out why it works in the first place and then try to generalize it to a more significant problem altogether. This kind of money transfer service was definitely going to work—it just needed to get off the ground.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Buchanan emphasizes what he likes to call \"macro-optimism.\" Startups are roller coasters with many highs and lows. But it's important not to fixate on the near-term highs, which might deceive you and throw you off track. And it's also important to not fixate on the short-term lows—one screw-up doesn't mean your company's story has come to an end. Much of his time is now spent trying to improve relationships with vendors who manage nearly the entire payments ecosystem and helping them understand the volume Plastiq unlocks.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Of course, he stresses out about people, on finding the right fit at the right time, and knowing how to help them grow at Plastiq. One of his first hires, originally in CS and now moving into the product organization, worked at a coffee shop at the time. Plastiq kicks employees out of the office at the five-year mark for a little more than a month and a check for $5,000 to go somewhere fun.
