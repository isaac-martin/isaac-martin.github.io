More specifically, a 401(k) lets workers save and invest a portion of their paycheck on a pre-tax basis, meaning that funds are diverted from payroll to a 401(k) investment account before taxes are taken out. Taxes are not paid on the money that is set aside until the funds are withdrawn from the account, often during the worker’s retirement. In a way, this is a sanctioned form of tax arbitrage, as most people will have a lower tax rate in retirement than they do while they are working full time, assuming that they will be earning less at the time of retirement.
