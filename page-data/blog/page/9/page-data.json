While great in theory, it is important to consider that LLCs are not particularly scalable. Pass through taxation makes sense for people who have large ownership stakes in the LLC (i.e. founders and early investors), but as you add investors and employees with smaller ownership stakes, it is impractical (and often impossible) for them to have the profits and losses of your LLC passed through to them. For example, imagine you have an employee who owns a small percentage of the company and the company makes a profit for the year.

While great in theory, it is important to consider that LLCs are not particularly scalable. Pass through taxation makes sense for people who have large ownership stakes in the LLC (i.e. founders and early investors), but as you add investors and employees with smaller ownership stakes, it is impractical (and often impossible) for them to have the profits and losses of your LLC passed through to them. For example, imagine you have an employee who owns a small percentage of the company and the company makes a profit for the year.

Categorizing and documenting candidates properly ensures your startup looks professional and organized – which is critical in competitive hiring markets. Without careful tracking, you will not be able to avoid mistakes like reaching out a second time to a candidate that already said no, or forgetting to schedule follow up interviews. These mistakes counter the positive word of mouth you are spending so much effort to produce.

Gusto is also very popular and has been successfully administering payroll for a number of years. It is a great option. The primary downsides of Gusto are that you can only use its benefits provider if you have over five employees. Many startups want to use one system to onboard employees as well as establish both payroll and benefits, so if you are currently a team smaller than five you won’t yet be able to use the Gusto platform for everything.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Rippling is a new entrant to the space.

While great in theory, it is important to consider that LLCs are not particularly scalable. Pass through taxation makes sense for people who have large ownership stakes in the LLC (i.e. founders and early investors), but as you add investors and employees with smaller ownership stakes, it is impractical (and often impossible) for them to have the profits and losses of your LLC passed through to them. For example, imagine you have an employee who owns a small percentage of the company and the company makes a profit for the year.

Taxes are not paid on the money that is set aside until the funds are withdrawn from the account, often during the worker’s retirement. In a way, this is a sanctioned form of tax arbitrage, as most people will have a lower tax rate in retirement than they do while they are working full time, assuming that they will be earning less at the time of retirement.
