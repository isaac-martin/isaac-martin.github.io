The stakes are now dramatically higher when you're moving many billions of dollars of others’ money from point A to point B, and it requires a combination of agility and carefully-thought-out plans. Raising money on the east coast wasn't a simple task, either.

But that also came with the challenges of uprooting an entire company and juggling a whole array of different cliques and cultures.

But it's important not to fixate on the near-term highs, which might deceive you and throw you off track. And it's also important to not fixate on the short-term lows—one screw-up doesn't mean your company's story has come to an end.
