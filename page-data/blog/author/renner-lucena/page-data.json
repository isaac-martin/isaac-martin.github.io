Analyst at Brex","biography":"During my Sophomore summer at Stanford, I joined Brex as its first intern, when the company had just launched and had about 30 people. I started working with the Marketing and Growth teams and continued to work part-time during my Junior year at Stanford. I rejoined the company in the Summer of 2019 and worked more on the Finance, Capital Markets and Ops teams. In 2020, I joined Brex full-time on the Data team, due to my passion for data and analytics.","linkedInHandle":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/renner-lucena-555250103/"},"uniqueCategories":["Ecommerce","Getting Started","Scaling","Brex Research","Fundraising","Hiring","Life Sciences","announcements","Customer Stories","Launching","Data"]}}}
