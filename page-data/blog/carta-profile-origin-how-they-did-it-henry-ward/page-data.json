While $20 per certificate on paper seemed like it would add up quickly, the message was clear: Carta was making the process of issuing a stock cert cheaper. That process requires a paralegal to handle some of the mechanical elements, which can end up costing more than $100.

You can always change it later.\"","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"While the products seem niche, they all serve the same network—and it's the investors and companies in that network that make its growth possible. If a venture capitalist uses a Carta product and likes it, there's a good bet they might recommend another Carta product to their portfolio companies. In the early days Carta would manufacture discount codes for those companies, but a lot of times it was merely about writing an email that was easy to forward.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"When Carta got started in 2012, \"fintech\" just meant payments. It was a time when companies like Venmo or Stripe were considered young fintech upstarts. At the time, Carta was called eShares.

After whittling down from 50 names, eShares became Carta.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"\"I'm always paranoid that we're going to run out of oxygen,\" Ward said. \"We launched cap tables in January 2014. In April 2014, we launched 409A valuations. And then in October, we launched expense accounting. We've just been launching new products every three to six months.

There’s an immediate trend that stands out in that list, though: they’re wrongfully stigmatized areas of health that Nurx wants to make more widely available, Engesaeth said.
