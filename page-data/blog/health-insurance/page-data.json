While a cheaper version of Salesforce is great, Essentials has a five person user limit, so you may quickly find yourself needing to upgrade to a more expensive version. Essentials is built on the broader Salesforce platform, which is the most popular CRM globally, so once you’re ready, you can seamlessly upgrade to a more robust version. Migrating from one CRM to another is a painful undertaking, which often takes engineering resources, so it’s wise to choose a platform that’s scalable for the future.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{"target":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"qlyedcbd6576"}},"id":"2hAFHUWECs0iMIqgoq4qEW","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-12-03T18:45:53.205Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-25T15:16:57.402Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"CRM Comparison","description":"Table comparing the pricing and features of Copper, Salesforce and Pipedrive CRM Systems","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/qlyedcbd6576/2hAFHUWECs0iMIqgoq4qEW/d23b77be02475eb255e3f7b66e108258/Updated_Comparison.PNG","details":{"size":60222,"image":{"width":1291,"height":542}},"fileName":"Updated Comparison.PNG","contentType":"image/png"}}}},"content":[],"nodeType":"embedded-asset-block"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"},"category":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"qlyedcbd6576"}},"id":"2E8gOd5c3dXnb5rwQxalZl","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-01-29T05:32:21.430Z","updatedAt":"2019-01-29T05:32:21.430Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"category"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Getting Started"}},"urlPath":"crm-setup","author":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"qlyedcbd6576"}},"id":"MWhyWgL7oMkB48tsytjY8","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-05-31T00:45:46.741Z","updatedAt":"2019-05-31T00:45:46.741Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"author"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Michael Tannenbaum","picture":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"qlyedcbd6576"}},"id":"5zYIjHnCehWQkz8gVvJdCq","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2019-05-31T00:44:51.592Z","updatedAt":"2019-05-31T00:44:51.592Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"miket","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/qlyedcbd6576/5zYIjHnCehWQkz8gVvJdCq/d130c93087fd8d16169aabd4be094d7e/miket.jpg","details":{"size":83666,"image":{"width":500,"height":500}},"fileName":"miket.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"description":"Chief Financial Officer at Brex","biography":"Michael Tannenbaum is the Chief Financial Officer of Brex.
