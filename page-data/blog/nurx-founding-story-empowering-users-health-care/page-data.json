There’s an immediate trend that stands out in that list, though: they’re wrongfully stigmatized areas of health that Nurx wants to make more widely available, Engesaeth said.

Nurx was growing 30% every week and shifted its focus to finding as many ways to stay in touch with their user base as it continued to expand rapidly.

The stakes are now dramatically higher when you're moving many billions of dollars of others’ money from point A to point B, and it requires a combination of agility and carefully-thought-out plans. Raising money on the east coast wasn't a simple task, either.
