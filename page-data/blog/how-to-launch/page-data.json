Operating without a public presence made it tough to hire employees and get partnerships, but it was worth the sacrifice. Brex wanted to maximize the press and word-of-mouth for its launch, so waiting to release everything at once proved to be the right decision. To generate press, Brex co-Founder Henrique Dubugras met with ten reporters in New York City and San Francisco, all in person. We used an embargo strategy, meaning all the reporters were permitted to write about Brex on a mutually agreed upon time, at which point Brex issued its press release and the articles went live.
