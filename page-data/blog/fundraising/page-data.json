While great in theory, it is important to consider that LLCs are not particularly scalable.

For example, imagine you have an employee who owns a small percentage of the company and the company makes a profit for the year.

While great in theory, it is important to consider that LLCs are not particularly scalable.

For example, imagine you have an employee who owns a small percentage of the company and the company makes a profit for the year.

Instead, the profits or losses earned by the company are “passed through” to the owners, even though the owners are shielded from the legal and financial exposure of the LLC. While great in theory, it is important to consider that LLCs are not particularly scalable. Pass through taxation makes sense for people who have large ownership stakes in the LLC (i.e. founders and early investors), but as you add investors and employees with smaller ownership stakes, it is impractical (and often impossible) for them to have the profits and losses of your LLC passed through to them. For example, imagine you have an employee who owns a small percentage of the company and the company makes a profit for the year. In an LLC structure, that employee would have to report this annual profit on their tax returns, and pay taxes on it, even if the profit was not distributed as a dividend to the employee.  ","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"What is a Benefit Corporation (B Corporation)?","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"heading-2"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Another choice, particularly mission-driven startups, is to pursue classification as a ","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"value":"Benefit Corporation ","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"(or B Corporation).
