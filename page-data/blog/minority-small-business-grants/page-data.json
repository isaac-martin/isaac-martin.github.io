Merchants pay a fee (called interchange) to accept a credit card, which is usually somewhere between 2.5% to 3%. Plastiq charges a fee at the front of the transaction for the customer to convert that credit card payment to an ACH, check, or wire transaction. The  payment then goes through like any normal one. This opens up payment volume for card issuers from merchants that wouldn’t otherwise take a credit card.

One of the earliest was with the CEO and chairman of MasterCard, Ajay Banga—and he only had a Visa card on him for a demo. He soon learned that it was always worthwhile to ask for a meeting because you never know who might say yes. Buchanan also said he quickly turned the meeting around by convincing Banga to use his card instead.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Thinking on your feet is a pretty common trend in Buchanan's origin story. There was the time he took a customer service call in the middle of an urgent hospital visit to remove his appendix. Or the time he had to dodge a near-catastrophic customer experience with one of Plastiq's early payments providers that shut off the business after the 1st payment. Or when he had to convince his parents to offer their home as collateral for a barely-proven business. You could say the timing was right, and there was some luck. But there was also an enormous amount of legwork making all that possible in the first place.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Buchanan still remembers the name of his first customer off the top of his head—and another near-miss that came with them. The stakes are now dramatically higher when you're moving many billions of dollars of others’ money from point A to point B, and it requires a combination of agility and carefully-thought-out plans. Raising money on the east coast wasn't a simple task, either. Plastiq, based in Boston, had to deal with a long series of \"no\"s from investors looking for hard evidence that the products were working. Out in Silicon Valley, investors will often take a bet on the team and the idea.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Eventually, Ryan Moore of Accomplice—a successful early stage fund in Boston—took an early bet on Buchanan and the rest of the team. Eventually, they ended up moving out to the Bay Area for all the reasons you might expect for a technology startup: talent, resources, and of course, more money. But that also came with the challenges of uprooting an entire company and juggling a whole array of different cliques and cultures. Getting everyone on the same page is one of a startup's biggest challenges, and these days Buchanan tries to be as transparent as possible with the team.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"\"You can often oversell, and you can get good at that,\" he said. \"Some of the hires who were probably the weakest fits have been actually really strong individuals and great people.

Now, I can't tell you how incredibly skeptical of Plastiq some of the best hires we've made in the last few years were.\"","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Like many successful startups, Plastiq's first launch was disappointing. “I’m not sure anything really worked on Day 1,” he said. Then, like many successful startups, Plastiq started doubling down on specific use cases. It's a strategy that works because it allows you to first figure out why it works in the first place and then try to generalize it to a more significant problem altogether. This kind of money transfer service was definitely going to work—it just needed to get off the ground.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Buchanan emphasizes what he likes to call \"macro-optimism.\" Startups are roller coasters with many highs and lows. But it's important not to fixate on the near-term highs, which might deceive you and throw you off track. And it's also important to not fixate on the short-term lows—one screw-up doesn't mean your company's story has come to an end. Much of his time is now spent trying to improve relationships with vendors who manage nearly the entire payments ecosystem and helping them understand the volume Plastiq unlocks.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Of course, he stresses out about people, on finding the right fit at the right time, and knowing how to help them grow at Plastiq. One of his first hires, originally in CS and now moving into the product organization, worked at a coffee shop at the time. Plastiq kicks employees out of the office at the five-year mark for a little more than a month and a check for $5,000 to go somewhere fun.
