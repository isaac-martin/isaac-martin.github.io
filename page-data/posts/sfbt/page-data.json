Brex would not be where it is today without the talented, hard-working and committed team that we’ve had from day one.”\nThe Best Places to Work survey is completed by employees from each award recipient, in which they evaluated and ranked their employers across multiple categories including culture, compensation, benefit offerings and management practices. This year’s submission process included a particular emphasis on employee wellness and mental health.</p>\n<p>This acknowledgement stems from Brex’s numerous policies and perks that directly benefit their employees including high quality health, workplace and commuter offerings as well as a culture that supports learning and professional development.  </p>\n<p>Additionally, Brex has maintained strong emphasis on hiring talent from foreign backgrounds — to date, 48% of Brex employees are first generation immigrants and come from 17 different countries.
