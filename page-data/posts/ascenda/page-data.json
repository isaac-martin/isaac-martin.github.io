Brex cardholders can now redeem their rewards points for airline miles in six major travel loyalty programs: Aeromexico - Club Premier, Air France KLM - Flying Blue, Asia Miles, Avianca LifeMiles, Qantas - Qantas Frequent Flyer, and Singapore Airlines - KrisFlyer. These travel partners represent flagship carriers across the three major global airline loyalty alliances: Oneworld, SkyTeam, and Star Alliance.</p>\n<p>The introduction of points transfers reflects Brex’s continued investment in its rewards program, which offers customers unparalleled benefits for their businesses. Brex is now adding its third redemption option, alongside the statement credit and rewards points travel booking it previously offered, increasing the flexibility to use Brex rewards points. For customers, this flexibility, along with the value of being able to exchange rewards points into airline miles to book flights for themselves or their employees, is unmatched.</p>\n<p>“The launch of the points transfer capability is a testament to Brex’s ongoing commitment to make its rewards offering the most valuable in the marketplace,” said Henrique Dubugras, co-founder and co-CEO of Brex. “This was the most-requested enhancement to Brex rewards by our existing customers, so we’re thrilled to be able to deliver on our promise of continued improvement and innovation.”</p>\n<p>In 2018, Brex introduced its rewards offering with points multipliers on categories popular among businesses including software, rideshare, and dining. It subsequently introduced a travel platform which allows Brex customers to both book and redeem their Brex rewards points for travel. By forming partnerships with product and service providers that offer discounts and promotions specifically to Brex cardholders, Brex has signup bonuses totaling over $50,000 in discounts for its customers. Additionally, Brex has unique signup offers targeted to its ecommerce and life sciences customers.</p>\n<p>\"We are proud to partner with Brex’s unique rewards program to design and launch unparalleled benefits that offer outsized, differentiated value to its business customers,\" said Kyle Armstrong, CEO of Ascenda. \"Both our organizations are committed to challenging the status quo with smart, innovative solutions that deliver meaningful customer value.\"</p>\n<h2>About Brex</h2>\n<p>Brex is transforming B2B payments by creating corporate cards, rewards, and travel programs that are tailored to specific industries.
