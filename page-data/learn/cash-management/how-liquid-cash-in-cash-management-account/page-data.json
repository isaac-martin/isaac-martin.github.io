This depends on how easy and how fast you can sell it when you want to and is one of the factors investors take into account when deciding on what they want to buy.\n\nHighly liquid assets are those for which there is always a market demand, and for which there is always an available mechanism to sell at short notice and at almost any quantity. They include investments such as money market funds and government money funds.\n\nIlliquid assets are less quick and easy to sell. A common example of this is real estate, for which you need to find an individual buyer at your desired market price in order to raise the value of your property as cash.\nSelling an individual property might be relatively easy in a healthy real estate market, but high-value and high-volume liquidations of commercial real estate takes much longer. \n\nLiquidity is about how fast you can dispose of an asset, but it also has a bearing on the value of that asset when it sells.\nIf you need to dispose of an illiquid asset quickly, you may be forced to accept less than the full market value; in contrast, liquid assets can usually be sold in the same period of time without losing value.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"7o1WWq7pmCCQqyNZVYZOKu","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-01-10T15:37:01.216Z","updatedAt":"2020-01-10T15:37:01.216Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Liquid cash vs. liquid assets"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"NimL3JDq1pM7pGDZkFbCC","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-01-10T15:37:19.148Z","updatedAt":"2020-03-04T09:48:24.631Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"You might hold a good proportion of your portfolio in highly liquid assets. This is a common technique among risk-averse investors who prioritize liquidity over net capital gains, dividends and interest.\n\nDoing so is a good way to improve your ability to release funds from your portfolio when you need cash at short notice to cover unexpected costs or bills.\n\nHolding liquid cash — literally a reserve of cash that you can spend no matter what your investment portfolio is doing — is a way to hedge against any severe economic shocks such as these.\n\nAt the same time, liquid assets are still relatively disposable compared with other investments, so a spread of liquid cash, liquid assets and illiquid long-term investments can balance short-term risks with long-term gains.\n\nFind out more about [Cash Management with Brex
