Network operators process ACH payments in batches three times a day rather than on an individual basis. The ACH network is responsible for processing around 25 billion electronic payments for every U.S. financial institution each year. This means ACH transfers can take several business days to clear.\n\nTimelines for ACH credits and debits are set out by the National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA). Accountholders initiate ACH credits themselves, and the ACH should process these within one to two business days. Organizations automatically “pull” funds from the customer’s account for ACH debits, making them ideal for recurring bill payments. The ACH should process these transactions the next business day. \n\nDelivery times may vary as some banks and credit unions place holds on these funds.

Banks place holds on deposits to ensure the funds clear into the recipient’s account before the withdrawal.

You should be able to withdraw checks the next business day if they are paid from the same financial institution as yours, from within the same state, or for small amounts. Cashier’s checks, direct deposits, and checks from the U.S. Treasury will also clear quickly.\n\nBanks outline their deposit policies, including holding times, and should notify you if there is a hold on your account. Even if the funds are showing in your checking account balance, they may not be available to withdraw. Make sure you understand the difference between your checking account’s actual balance and available balance to know which funds are free for use.\n\nFind out more about [ACH payments](https://brex.com/solution/ach-payments/) and [wire transfers](https://brex.com/solution/wire-transfers/) with Brex Cash.
