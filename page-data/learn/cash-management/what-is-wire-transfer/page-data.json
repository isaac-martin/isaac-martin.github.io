This lack of anonymity makes wire transfers a less attractive target for fraudsters. \n\nWire transfer scams are still possible. Transfers using cash shops or services are more vulnerable. Criminals can use fake IDs to collect payments, making it difficult to verify if the correct party received the funds.
