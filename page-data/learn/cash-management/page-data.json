When you use an Automated Clearing House transfer, you automate some or all of the payment process. By doing this, you cut the costs and time associated with mailing checks. Some ACH transactions clear on the same day they are initiated. \n\nACH transactions are also more affordable for merchants than debit card transactions. Rather than relying on card networks and payment processors, the Automated Clearing House directly connects two banks. There are no interchange fees, which can cost as much as 1% of debit card transactions, plus flat transaction fees. In contrast, ACH transactions are free.\n\nFor consumers, ACH debits are particularly convenient. You don’t need to pay recurring bills manually because organizations automatically deduct payments from your account. You cannot fall behind with late or missed payments, which can result in penalty charges. It is also a more environmentally-friendly payment option, as there is no need to transport paper checks via mail.\n\nIt is important to keep track of ACH debits using your bank statements or online banking. Automated payments can lead customers to pay less attention to their bills. This makes it difficult to identify billing errors or payments to services that are no longer in use. If you don’t keep enough money in your checking account, ACH debits can also cause you to become overdrawn and incur fees. Therefore, always check the billing date and amount due on any ACH debits you have set up.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"2uUzGIoPjySeuoXKI5phbt","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-03-04T14:37:40.838Z","updatedAt":"2020-03-04T14:37:40.838Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Are ACH payments secure?"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"4PCiaQ9uKVaKcP4qkGJo9a","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-02T16:42:27.952Z","updatedAt":"2020-03-04T14:37:32.039Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Although ACH debits do require you to hand over your checking account and routing numbers, you only need to provide these details once to set up automatic payments. This is much more secure than making bill payments by check, which exposes your bank account information monthly. There is also no risk of your payment being lost or stolen with ACH debits. \n\nACH credits can also be a safer option for one-off payments than [wire transfers](https://brex.com/learn/cash-management/wire-transfers-ach-difference/), which are difficult to reverse. They may also be less vulnerable to fraud than some money transfer services. All recipients of ACH payments must have a U.S. bank account, making it easier for law enforcement to track criminal activity.\n\nWhile it is advisable to pay attention to any bills paid via ACH debit, you are still protected by federal law if something goes wrong. You can dispute ACH debit payments if they were taken on the incorrect date, for the wrong amount, or not authorized. The criteria for disputing ACH debits is narrower than credit card transactions, and you must report any issues within 60 days to your bank.\n\nFind out about [ACH payments with Brex

Using a credit card for wire transfers can also incur cash advance fees and higher rates of interest.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"7yKmizbrB0WKTIx8ytZJdS","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-02T16:30:58.586Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-02T16:30:58.586Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Speed: wire transfer vs ACH"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"65kMcW4seuaqM4KIGaVN2A","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-02T16:30:46.676Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-02T16:30:46.676Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Wire transfers are much faster than ACH payments.

ACH transfers are ideal for recurring payments, such as for businesses who need to pay employee wages. \n\nThey are also a convenient option for recurring bills, which can be automated using ACH debits. By setting up an ACH debit, customers don’t have to worry about late or missed payments. ACH credit can also be used for one-off payments, to authorize an organization to pull funds from your account. This method is more affordable for organizations, too, as it reduces processing fees. \n\nDue to their higher cost, the main advantage of a wire transfer is speed. If it is critical to get funds from one account to another quickly, such as when making a down payment on a property purchase, then a wire transfer may be the best option. Otherwise, an ACH payment may offer more benefits. \n\nFind out more about [ACH payments](https://brex.com/solution/ach-payments/) and [wire transfers](https://brex.com/solution/wire-transfers/) with

Many of these banking products include protection, including limited personal liability protection and purchase protection for merchant services accounts. Merchant services make it possible for businesses to accept credit and debit transactions from customers. \n\nStart-up founders may choose to open their business account with the same bank as their personal account. This does have some benefits. It can make it simpler to manage all your financial responsibilities in one place. If you have poor credit, you may find it easier to get approval for a business account with a bank where you already have a history. Some banks also give customers exclusive deals if they hold both a business and a personal account with them.\n\n### Non-bank online business accounts\n\nOnline financial service providers offer alternatives to banks. These non-bank business account products are fully regulated and verify the details of the business and the identity of its owners to comply with legislation. As the services are all digital, the registration process can be quick and straightforward. \n\nThese alternative banking options often feature innovative tech solutions which can make it easy to manage business finances, including connection to existing accounting software. Going digital also facilitates real-time notifications of charges and transfers, as well as borderless banking. This is ideal for organizations that need to conduct international transactions, as they may be able to take advantage of fast [international wire transfers](https://brex.com/learn/cash-management/international-wire-transfers-guide/) at low costs. \n\n### Business cash management accounts\nNon-bank financial service providers can also offer business cash management accounts (CMAs). These streamline the management of business finances by delivering similar services to a checking, savings, and investment account in a single product. They can feature check writing, a credit line, overdraft programs, and FDIC insurance from a third-party bank. \n\nAnother benefit of CMAs is that they tend to offer higher interest rates. For example, the [Brex Cash](https://brex.com/product/business-cash-account/) account gives customers an industry-leading yield with no transaction fees for wire transfers. Many CMAs offer zero fees thanks to the lower operating costs of online-exclusive banking services.

These credit options can be available on revolving or non-revolving and secured or unsecured terms. All borrowing products offer companies the opportunity to build a credit history to improve their [business credit score](https://brex.com/learn/loans-credit-scores/what-is-business-credit-score/). \n\n### Business credit cards\n\nBusiness credit cards are available to organizations of all sizes, including start-ups and sole proprietors. Applicants only need to have a  good personal credit score and give a personal guarantee to be eligible. These credit cards can come with high [credit limits](https://brex.com/learn/loans-credit-scores/what-is-credit-limit/), giving companies more financial flexibility and higher purchasing power.\n\nOwners can authorize employees to use their business credit account for approved expenses. By doing so, they can spread the responsibility of day-to-day banking tasks and run operations more effectively. They also tend to come with reward points that incentivize spending. Points can be redeemable on everything from frequent flyer miles to cash rewards and purchases at participating retailers.\n\n### Business lines of credit\nBusiness [lines of credit](https://brex.com/learn/loans-credit-scores/what-is-line-of-credit/) (LOCs) can be an ideal way to meet short-term cash flow needs, like purchasing equipment or providing relief through slump seasons and emergencies. Although they are similar to business credit cards, they typically come with lower [APR](https://brex.com/learn/loans-credit-scores/understanding-apr/) and are a more affordable way to take out [cash advances](https://brex.com/learn/corporate-card/credit-card-cash-advance/). \n\nCompanies have access to revolving credit with a LOC, meaning they can draw capital whenever necessary up to a preset limit. Interest is only due on the amount spent and, unlike credit cards, there is no requirement to make monthly payments. \n\n### Term loans\nTerm loans are another popular choice for businesses looking to finance essential expenses. They are a more method suitable for funding larger investments and big-ticket purchases than credit cards or LOCs, due to the lump sum payment and low-interest rates. The borrowing terms of loans, including the amount and repayment duration, can be flexible to suit the needs of the company. \n\nLoans are temporary, and once the borrower repays the full balance and interest, the account closes. This makes repayment schedules for loans straightforward and predictable, as the same amount is due each billing cycle. As a result, budgeting and accounting are simpler for businesses, with the interest of a term loan being tax-deductible. \n\n### Net terms\nIf your business relies on inventory from a supplier or vendor, it can be worth negotiating [net terms](https://brex.com/learn/corporate-card/what-are-net-payment-terms/) with them. This option involves suppliers fronting vital stock to companies and deferring payment for an agreed period. It can be quick to get approval through a short trade credit application process, and it lets businesses get the goods they need without delay. \n\nCommon net terms include Net 30, Net 60 and Net 90.
