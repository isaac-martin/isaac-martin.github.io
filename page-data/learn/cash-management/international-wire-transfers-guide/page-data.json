You can provide the recipient’s details by visiting a branch, calling your bank, or filling out an online form. Fees will vary depending on the bank and the location of the recipient.\n\nWire transfers through non-bank transfer services tend to come with lower costs. It may also be more convenient to complete the process online rather than visiting your branch in person. You will need to create an account with the organization and wire money online or over the phone. Once you make the payment, the organization will forward it to the recipient’s account. \n\nThese services can also offer you more flexibility when it comes to choosing exchange rates. Options include transferring funds at the current exchange rate, which can be quicker and simpler but may cost more. \n\nYou can also choose a forward contract. This is ideal if you want today’s competitive exchange rates, but need to transfer funds at a later date, as you can lock-in the current rates for up to 12 months. \n\nYou may also be able to opt for a limit order. Nominate your preferred exchange rate, and the transfer service will make your payment as soon as this rate is available. Limit orders can last up to 12 months, but tend to come with high minimum transaction amounts.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"1kpP4rpNhrgLHkkliUBJo0","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-02T16:52:53.310Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-02T16:52:53.310Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Considerations when sending international wire transfers"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"6uaEHsYdBP3ARi4Ir2nuRQ","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-02T16:53:31.989Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-02T16:53:31.989Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"The Office of Foreign Assets Control monitors international wire transfers sent from the United States.
