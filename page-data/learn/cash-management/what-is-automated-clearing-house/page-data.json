This allows for the electronic transfer of funds across accounts, making payments quicker and simpler. \n\nThere are two types of ACH transactions:\n\n1. __ACH credit__ requires the account holder to initiate the transaction themselves. \n2. __ACH transactions__ reduce the time and costs associated with sending paper checks and are ideal for one-off payments. \n\nWhile ACH credits are similar to “pushing” funds from your account, ACH debits are more like having that money “pulled” by an organization. This makes it a great option for recurring bills, such as monthly phone bills, as the organization will automatically pull money from the account when payment becomes due."}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"Mr8KO6jAOXsBMTlOgBRAp","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-03-04T11:06:54.439Z","updatedAt":"2020-03-04T11:06:54.439Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"What is an ACH number?"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"2A4Mt6t9lklJCQ4Q2qyOlj","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-03-04T11:09:39.703Z","updatedAt":"2020-03-04T11:09:39.704Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"To authorize an ACH debit transaction, the account holder will need to provide authorization in writing, as well as giving their checking bank account and ACH number.

When you use an Automated Clearing House transfer, you automate some or all of the payment process. By doing this, you cut the costs and time associated with mailing checks. Some ACH transactions clear on the same day they are initiated. \n\nACH transactions are also more affordable for merchants than debit card transactions. Rather than relying on card networks and payment processors, the Automated Clearing House directly connects two banks. There are no interchange fees, which can cost as much as 1% of debit card transactions, plus flat transaction fees. In contrast, ACH transactions are free.\n\nFor consumers, ACH debits are particularly convenient. You don’t need to pay recurring bills manually because organizations automatically deduct payments from your account. You cannot fall behind with late or missed payments, which can result in penalty charges. It is also a more environmentally-friendly payment option, as there is no need to transport paper checks via mail.\n\nIt is important to keep track of ACH debits using your bank statements or online banking. Automated payments can lead customers to pay less attention to their bills. This makes it difficult to identify billing errors or payments to services that are no longer in use. If you don’t keep enough money in your checking account, ACH debits can also cause you to become overdrawn and incur fees. Therefore, always check the billing date and amount due on any ACH debits you have set up.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"2uUzGIoPjySeuoXKI5phbt","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-03-04T14:37:40.838Z","updatedAt":"2020-03-04T14:37:40.838Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Are ACH payments secure?"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"4PCiaQ9uKVaKcP4qkGJo9a","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-02T16:42:27.952Z","updatedAt":"2020-03-04T14:37:32.039Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Although ACH debits do require you to hand over your checking account and routing numbers, you only need to provide these details once to set up automatic payments. This is much more secure than making bill payments by check, which exposes your bank account information monthly. There is also no risk of your payment being lost or stolen with ACH debits. \n\nACH credits can also be a safer option for one-off payments than [wire transfers](https://brex.com/learn/cash-management/wire-transfers-ach-difference/), which are difficult to reverse. They may also be less vulnerable to fraud than some money transfer services. All recipients of ACH payments must have a U.S. bank account, making it easier for law enforcement to track criminal activity.\n\nWhile it is advisable to pay attention to any bills paid via ACH debit, you are still protected by federal law if something goes wrong. You can dispute ACH debit payments if they were taken on the incorrect date, for the wrong amount, or not authorized. The criteria for disputing ACH debits is narrower than credit card transactions, and you must report any issues within 60 days to your bank.\n\nFind out about [ACH payments with Brex
