You can conduct all your transactions from a single account instead of using separate accounts for different banking functions.\n\nCommon features include a debit card, checkbook, money transfers, bill payments, and overdraft programs. They can also include FDIC insurance, which is often available through a third-party bank, as well as a credit line that attaches to your investment securities. \n\nAll this eliminates the need to transfer funds between a checking and savings account. It also makes it easier to monitor all your finances in one place, saving you time and improving the efficiency of your cash management.\n\nCMAs benefit from lower overheads and operational costs as they are online-exclusive banking services rather than accounts from traditional banks. This means the financial service provider can offer customers low or no fees, including on [Automated Clearing House](https://brex.com/learn/cash-management/what-is-automated-clearing-house/) and [wire transfers](https://brex.com/learn/cash-management/what-is-wire-transfer/).

Some other financial products may be able to offer better rates. Take all the account features, fees, and interest rates into consideration to make sure you are choosing the banking product that is the best fit for you and your financial objectives. \n\nFind out
