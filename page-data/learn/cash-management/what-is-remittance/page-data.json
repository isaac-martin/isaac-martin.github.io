They are seen as a courtesy, as they assist suppliers in matching payments with invoices and record-keeping.

The most convenient method is by email. Notifying the supplier and creating a reference can be helpful for their records even if you make an online payment, \n\nAsk the supplier for the appropriate email address before sending it. It may not be visible to the accounts department and could get lost if you send it to the general company email address.\n\nYou can also send a remittance advice slip through the mail as a letter. This is common practice for customers who pay by check and tends to be sent at the same time as the payment. If the invoice includes a remittance advice section, detach this, complete it, and return it to the address provided by the supplier.\n\nFind out about [Cash Management with Brex
