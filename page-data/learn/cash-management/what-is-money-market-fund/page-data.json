The SEC issues guidelines that dictate which investments, including their maturity and other characteristics, are allowed in a money market fund.\n\nThis is under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which also regulates other investment securities in the US.\n\n- Significant regulatory requirements  include:Maturity should be less than 13 months.\n- Money market funds should mainly invest in top-rated debt instruments.\n- Weighted average maturity in the portfolio should be 60 days or less.\n\nThe weighted average maturity, or WAM, is calculated by taking the average maturity of the invested instruments, allowing for their relative weights in the portfolio. By keeping this below 60 days, the total liquidity of the fund is protected so that investors' funds cannot be locked into instruments with long-term maturity and poor liquidity.\n\nThere is also a requirement that no more than 5% of a money market fund portfolio can be invested with a single issuer (outside of government issued securities). This limit helps to avoid isolated risks that can occur when an issuer encounters difficulties that do not affect the wider market.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"1onIIS3pJjRuGQ2S76y1n7","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-12-19T14:37:40.040Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-19T14:37:40.040Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Why investors choose money market funds"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"3R0QWZmWVgyVZSzkekyKVO","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-12-19T14:37:56.627Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-19T14:37:56.627Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Money market funds may be thought of as a low-risk, low-return instrument, and as such, some investors consider them part of a short-term strategy to invest large sums of money and achieve greater net returns.

their appeal, as does the ability to invest in tax-exempt municipal securities at federal level and to a lesser extent at state level.\n\nBecause money market funds do not provide for meaningful capital appreciation, they are  are generally not used as part of long-term value investing; for example, investors are unlikely to look to money market funds as a method of planning for retirement.\n\nOn balance, a money market fund aims to offer investors a relatively safe way to invest in secure, accessible, liquid debt-based assets, and are often used as an investment product when individuals and businesses exceed their FDIC insurance
