You can find all the information you need on a personal check, by contacting your bank, or logging into your online banking account. In some cases, the organization may allow you to provide these details with a voided check.\n\nTo make payments by direct deposit, you will need a business bank account, bookkeeping software, or a payroll provider that allows you to send ACH payments.

It is also a good idea to check with your accountant to ensure you understand any regulations and disclosures relating to direct deposits.\n\nFind out about [Cash Management with Brex
