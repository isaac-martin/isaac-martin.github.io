When you use an Automated Clearing House transfer, you automate some or all of the payment process. By doing this, you cut the costs and time associated with mailing checks. Some ACH transactions clear on the same day they are initiated. \n\nACH transactions are also more affordable for merchants than debit card transactions. Rather than relying on card networks and payment processors, the Automated Clearing House directly connects two banks. There are no interchange fees, which can cost as much as 1% of debit card transactions, plus flat transaction fees. In contrast, ACH transactions are free.\n\nFor consumers, ACH debits are particularly convenient. You don’t need to pay recurring bills manually because organizations automatically deduct payments from your account. You cannot fall behind with late or missed payments, which can result in penalty charges. It is also a more environmentally-friendly payment option, as there is no need to transport paper checks via mail.\n\nIt is important to keep track of ACH debits using your bank statements or online banking. Automated payments can lead customers to pay less attention to their bills. This makes it difficult to identify billing errors or payments to services that are no longer in use. If you don’t keep enough money in your checking account, ACH debits can also cause you to become overdrawn and incur fees. Therefore, always check the billing date and amount due on any ACH debits you have set up.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"2uUzGIoPjySeuoXKI5phbt","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-03-04T14:37:40.838Z","updatedAt":"2020-03-04T14:37:40.838Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Are ACH payments secure?"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"4PCiaQ9uKVaKcP4qkGJo9a","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-02T16:42:27.952Z","updatedAt":"2020-03-04T14:37:32.039Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Although ACH debits do require you to hand over your checking account and routing numbers, you only need to provide these details once to set up automatic payments. This is much more secure than making bill payments by check, which exposes your bank account information monthly. There is also no risk of your payment being lost or stolen with ACH debits. \n\nACH credits can also be a safer option for one-off payments than [wire transfers](https://brex.com/learn/cash-management/wire-transfers-ach-difference/), which are difficult to reverse. They may also be less vulnerable to fraud than some money transfer services. All recipients of ACH payments must have a U.S. bank account, making it easier for law enforcement to track criminal activity.\n\nWhile it is advisable to pay attention to any bills paid via ACH debit, you are still protected by federal law if something goes wrong. You can dispute ACH debit payments if they were taken on the incorrect date, for the wrong amount, or not authorized. The criteria for disputing ACH debits is narrower than credit card transactions, and you must report any issues within 60 days to your bank.\n\nFind out about [ACH payments with Brex

Using a credit card for wire transfers can also incur cash advance fees and higher rates of interest.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"7yKmizbrB0WKTIx8ytZJdS","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-02T16:30:58.586Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-02T16:30:58.586Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Speed: wire transfer vs ACH"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"65kMcW4seuaqM4KIGaVN2A","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-02T16:30:46.676Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-02T16:30:46.676Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Wire transfers are much faster than ACH payments.

ACH transfers are ideal for recurring payments, such as for businesses who need to pay employee wages. \n\nThey are also a convenient option for recurring bills, which can be automated using ACH debits. By setting up an ACH debit, customers don’t have to worry about late or missed payments. ACH credit can also be used for one-off payments, to authorize an organization to pull funds from your account. This method is more affordable for organizations, too, as it reduces processing fees. \n\nDue to their higher cost, the main advantage of a wire transfer is speed. If it is critical to get funds from one account to another quickly, such as when making a down payment on a property purchase, then a wire transfer may be the best option. Otherwise, an ACH payment may offer more benefits. \n\nFind out more about [ACH payments](https://brex.com/solution/ach-payments/) and [wire transfers](https://brex.com/solution/wire-transfers/) with

Many of these banking products include protection, including limited personal liability protection and purchase protection for merchant services accounts. Merchant services make it possible for businesses to accept credit and debit transactions from customers. \n\nStart-up founders may choose to open their business account with the same bank as their personal account. This does have some benefits. It can make it simpler to manage all your financial responsibilities in one place. If you have poor credit, you may find it easier to get approval for a business account with a bank where you already have a history. Some banks also give customers exclusive deals if they hold both a business and a personal account with them.\n\n### Non-bank online business accounts\n\nOnline financial service providers offer alternatives to banks. These non-bank business account products are fully regulated and verify the details of the business and the identity of its owners to comply with legislation. As the services are all digital, the registration process can be quick and straightforward. \n\nThese alternative banking options often feature innovative tech solutions which can make it easy to manage business finances, including connection to existing accounting software. Going digital also facilitates real-time notifications of charges and transfers, as well as borderless banking. This is ideal for organizations that need to conduct international transactions, as they may be able to take advantage of fast [international wire transfers](https://brex.com/learn/cash-management/international-wire-transfers-guide/) at low costs. \n\n### Business cash management accounts\nNon-bank financial service providers can also offer business cash management accounts (CMAs). These streamline the management of business finances by delivering similar services to a checking, savings, and investment account in a single product. They can feature check writing, a credit line, overdraft programs, and FDIC insurance from a third-party bank. \n\nAnother benefit of CMAs is that they tend to offer higher interest rates. For example, the [Brex Cash](https://brex.com/product/business-cash-account/) account gives customers an industry-leading yield with no transaction fees for wire transfers. Many CMAs offer zero fees thanks to the lower operating costs of online-exclusive banking services.

These credit options can be available on revolving or non-revolving and secured or unsecured terms. All borrowing products offer companies the opportunity to build a credit history to improve their [business credit score](https://brex.com/learn/loans-credit-scores/what-is-business-credit-score/). \n\n### Business credit cards\n\nBusiness credit cards are available to organizations of all sizes, including start-ups and sole proprietors. Applicants only need to have a  good personal credit score and give a personal guarantee to be eligible. These credit cards can come with high [credit limits](https://brex.com/learn/loans-credit-scores/what-is-credit-limit/), giving companies more financial flexibility and higher purchasing power.\n\nOwners can authorize employees to use their business credit account for approved expenses. By doing so, they can spread the responsibility of day-to-day banking tasks and run operations more effectively. They also tend to come with reward points that incentivize spending. Points can be redeemable on everything from frequent flyer miles to cash rewards and purchases at participating retailers.\n\n### Business lines of credit\nBusiness [lines of credit](https://brex.com/learn/loans-credit-scores/what-is-line-of-credit/) (LOCs) can be an ideal way to meet short-term cash flow needs, like purchasing equipment or providing relief through slump seasons and emergencies. Although they are similar to business credit cards, they typically come with lower [APR](https://brex.com/learn/loans-credit-scores/understanding-apr/) and are a more affordable way to take out [cash advances](https://brex.com/learn/corporate-card/credit-card-cash-advance/). \n\nCompanies have access to revolving credit with a LOC, meaning they can draw capital whenever necessary up to a preset limit. Interest is only due on the amount spent and, unlike credit cards, there is no requirement to make monthly payments. \n\n### Term loans\nTerm loans are another popular choice for businesses looking to finance essential expenses. They are a more method suitable for funding larger investments and big-ticket purchases than credit cards or LOCs, due to the lump sum payment and low-interest rates. The borrowing terms of loans, including the amount and repayment duration, can be flexible to suit the needs of the company. \n\nLoans are temporary, and once the borrower repays the full balance and interest, the account closes. This makes repayment schedules for loans straightforward and predictable, as the same amount is due each billing cycle. As a result, budgeting and accounting are simpler for businesses, with the interest of a term loan being tax-deductible. \n\n### Net terms\nIf your business relies on inventory from a supplier or vendor, it can be worth negotiating [net terms](https://brex.com/learn/corporate-card/what-are-net-payment-terms/) with them. This option involves suppliers fronting vital stock to companies and deferring payment for an agreed period. It can be quick to get approval through a short trade credit application process, and it lets businesses get the goods they need without delay. \n\nCommon net terms include Net 30, Net 60 and Net 90.

A lower score can also result in less competitive borrowing terms, such as higher interest rates and lower credit limits.\n\n### How long does a credit administrative hold last?\n\nIf a hold is in place due to an exceeded credit limit, this will last until payment has been made to bring the account balance under the limit again. In the case of late payments, the hold will be in effect until the account holder has made several on-time payments to demonstrate that they are a responsible borrower. For regular late payments, the issuer could cancel your card. \n\nTo avoid the risk of facing an administrative hold, consider using banking alerts.

Reward points can fluctuate in value between card issuers and even change over time. Check that your credit card rewards remain competitive once the sign-up bonus ends and shop around to find the best deal.\n\nRead the terms and conditions of the card to ensure you qualify. Many issuers will not allow you to redeem sign-up bonuses if you already have another account with them. Some companies limit their bonuses to one per lifetime, including on personal and [small business cards](https://brex.com/learn/corporate-card/corporate-vs-business-credit-card/).\n\nThe terms will also outline which transactions count towards the minimum spending threshold.

For billing disputes, contact your credit card issuer so they can demand a chargeback from the merchant. \n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"3BWk3ut6uAThbGgyG55xZf","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-22T20:49:17.731Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-22T20:49:17.731Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"How long will the refund take?"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"53p7vPyIgBjs5j3frvZPyx","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-22T20:49:47.002Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-22T20:49:47.002Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"The return method and retailer’s policies affect how long it takes for you to receive a credit card refund.

Each cardholder may also have a custom rule set. For example, senior managers may have higher limits than sales staff to allow for expenses such as business travel.\n\nAll businesses should outline clear policies when issuing corporate credit cards for employees. This allows each cardholder to fully understand the rules and regulations, liability, credit limits, and expense procedures. \n\nA corporate credit card policy should inform employees how they are expected to use their corporate credit cards, as well as the consequences if they breach the terms of use. These policies will vary by business.\n\n### Eligibility of employees\n\nOne of the first sections of a corporate credit card policy should outline which employees are eligible to become authorized cardholders. It should also provide details on how employees can be approved for a card. They should know whether they are required to apply themselves or if the company will issue one directly to them. \n\n### Authorized Usage\n\nCorporate credit cards should fund approved businesses expenses only. Employees, therefore, need to understand what counts as an allowable expense and which charges are prohibited. (You probably don’t want every employee automatically upgrading their flights to first class if they don’t need it.)\n\n### Liability\n\nLiability for the repayment of corporate credit card balances can lie with the company or be shared with cardholders. Joint liability requires employees to make payments for their transactions and receive reimbursement through expense reports. This can keep employees accountable for their purchases.\n\nRegardless of liability, the policy should include information on who is responsible for repayments and replacement of lost cards, along with the company’s right to suspend and cancel individual cards at any time. \n\n### Expense reporting procedure\n\nEmployees will need to know how to submit expense reports to receive repayment if they have joint liability for payments on their corporate credit cards. The policy should inform them of the required receipts, as well as the monthly dates for expense report submittal, approval, and reimbursement. \n\n### Spending limits\n\nBusinesses should set out their spending limits, including any frequency limits or restrictions on certain expense categories like travel and entertainment. The policy should also explain if employees are subject to different spending limits on their corporate credit cards."}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"3RtF98BhO8xYBsujGkHJV0","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-21T00:51:03.458Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-21T00:51:03.458Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Consequences for violations"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"sviU0YlpWiPQUEhVPNqyO","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-21T00:51:18.294Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-21T00:51:18.294Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Unfortunately, employee misuse of credit card funds does happen.

Try contacting your issuer first to see if you can renegotiate the terms of your account. They may reduce annual fees or interest rates for responsible borrowers over a set period.

If you no longer use the account, put the card in a drawer or cut it up to avoid spending on it. Remember that issuers can close your account due to inactivity, so you may need to make small purchases every now and again.\n\nJoint credit cardholders should close their account if they are separating or have serious disagreements about its management.

Cardholders may also redeem these points as cash or gift cards, depending on the terms of the issuer. \n\nBy accumulating points, corporate credit card customers can get perks for their day-to-day spending. This can make it easier for them to make purchases, reward their employees, or entertain clients. \n\n### Miles and travel rewards\nTravel is critical for many companies. That’s why some corporate [credit cards reward customers with miles](https://brex.com/travel/), which can be redeemed for airline tickets. The value of these miles will vary depending on the frequent flier program. \n\nSome issuers may also offer point multipliers which pay higher rewards on travel purchases, such as flights, accommodation, and transfers.\n\n### Cash rewards\nCorporate credit card customers can also earn monetary rewards. These can be redeemed at specific increments or for a set minimum amount. \n\nDespite their name, customers won’t necessarily receive such rewards in cash. They may be paid as credit into the account, made as a deposit, or sent as a check. Some issuers will also allow you to redeem cash rewards as gift cards with their partner merchants. Doing so can sometimes be more valuable, with merchants giving you a certain percentage off orders. \n\n### Exclusive discounts with partners\nThe best credit card rewards are available alongside exclusive discounts with participating retailers. These can give customers money off the products and services they need to operate and expand their business. \n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"1UoWvb2CDGTmrH0Nkn2efV","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-11T00:25:04.302Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-11T00:25:04.302Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Things to consider with credit card rewards"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"2zayuh62LoPknWXG1IZ3bk","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-11T00:31:19.828Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-11T00:31:19.828Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Even the most rewarding credit cards can come with terms and conditions that limit the value of reward programs.

This means some companies may find it difficult to be approved. These reward credit cards can also cost more due to higher annual fees and interest rates.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"1PmaZXZpRLUE0NLRegUi8K","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-11T00:32:16.049Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-11T00:32:16.049Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"fourStepTile"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"articleLinks":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"31JFKfYuQFylADYxM5zqyr","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-20T23:36:46.390Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-09T08:54:02.110Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"articleHeader"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"category":"corporate-card","thumbnailImage":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"1j7HJzwaLDJeYdDulQ2ILV","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2019-09-30T23:40:38.340Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-30T23:40:38.340Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Thumbnail-what-are-net-terms","description":"what

The collateral will need to match or exceed the value of the LOC’s maximum limit and can come in the form of the company, its property, or equipment. \n\nSecured LOCs tend to offer higher credit limits and more competitive interest rates, as providing collateral mitigates the risk that the lender takes by extending the line of credit.\n\nIf a business defaults on payments and the lender seizes assets to recoup its losses, a secured loan allows the borrower to designate assets for possession.\n\n### Unsecured Lines of Credit\nAn unsecured line of credit does not require the borrower to provide any form of collateral. These are best suited to businesses seeking smaller credit limits up to around $100,000, as they tend to have lower maximum limits and higher interest rates. \n\nLenders can still seize personal assets for outstanding payments on unsecured business LOCs if the company is unable to provide the funds.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"7hRBLXKACqCfrA3IIY5YnI","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-21T23:25:58.230Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-21T23:25:58.230Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Qualifying For a Business Line of Credit"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"40zyHhaXkDbT8HfZxWSU7Z","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-21T23:26:13.032Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-21T23:26:13.032Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Lenders base interest rates, repayment terms, and maximum credit limits on several factors, including the business’ credit score, financial history, and revenue.\n\nTo qualify for a business line of credit, a company owner will typically need to provide evidence that they have at least $50,000 or more in annual revenue, one year in business, and a personal credit score of 550 or above.\n\nHowever, businesses with a lower credit score or less credit history may still be able to qualify for a short-term line of credit.

Make sure you do not start spending more on the account as a result of a higher limit. \n\nYou can also improve your overall utilization ratio by applying for a new credit account.

business credit score is a crucial insight into a company’s financial health and reliability. Lenders will use a credit score to assess how much of a financial risk a business is, based on a summary of the information in their business credit reports, whenever it submits any kind of credit application. \n\nA high business credit score is a good indication that a company will reliably make repayments on time. This will make it more likely that the company’s credit application will be accepted, and they’ll be offered more competitive rates. This score is also accessible by everyone from vendors and suppliers to landlords and business partners. \n\nIt’s important that companies don’t neglect their credit score and take the necessary steps to keep it as healthy as possible."}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"7JScipLqC7LjQtH111yxy","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-25T16:15:15.113Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-25T16:15:15.113Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"smallerImage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"smallerImage":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"1nyZUTvsaIQguv21SYESWI","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2019-09-25T16:11:04.264Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-25T16:11:04.264Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Business credit scores","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lrdkz6qgi9tt/1nyZUTvsaIQguv21SYESWI/99e5f27f8d1f435f89902f1f64c78294/Group.png","details":{"size":148039,"image":{"width":934,"height":392}},"fileName":"Group.png","contentType":"image/png"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"79rRnT7GCBdMZP3BGCsnQm","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-21T00:35:38.539Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-21T00:35:38.539Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"What affects your business credit score?"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"6YpFnWywCANCtZOEjW7AYq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-21T00:35:53.992Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-14T20:21:32.016Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Just like personal credit scores, there are various factors which determine a business credit score.

Anyone can view them, including potential suppliers and vendors. A low score may discourage potential partners from doing business with your company.

But there are several steps you can take to try to improve it if your business credit score isn’t as high as you’d like.\nYou can keep your score looking healthy by providing accurate and up-to-date information, responsibly managing your finances, and regularly reviewing your report. Here are some steps you can take to help give your business credit score a boost:\n\n__- Make payments on time or early:__Your business credit score takes your company’s payment history into account. Always make credit repayments on time or before they are due. Remember that [net terms](https://brex.com/learn/corporate-card/what-are-net-payment-terms/) are also a form of credit, so falling behind on these can also harm your score.\n__- Bring your credit utilization ratio down__: A credit utilization ratio measures the difference between the amount of credit available to your business and the amount that has been used. It’s recommended that you use less than 15% of your available credit. You can bring this ratio down by clearing balances, decreasing spending on your credit account, and increasing your overall credit limit. \n__- Avoid making multiple credit applications:__ Credit checks from lenders on your business appear on your credit report. Multiple credit applications in a short period can be an indication of financial difficulties. \n\n__- Regularly review your credit report:__ You can ensure all the information is accurate and up-to-date by keeping an eye on your credit reports. You can dispute inaccuracies and identify any unfamiliar inquiries or credit applications. This can be a sign of fraudulent activity, and you should [report it](https://brex.com/learn/fraud-security/report-credit-card-fraud/) to the credit bureau immediately. \n\n__- Ask suppliers to share data:__ If you have a good payment relationship with a supplier or vendor, you can request they provide data to the credit bureaus. The more positive feedback on your company’s payment performance, the better your credit score is likely to be. \n\n__- Check your suppliers’ credit:__ If a supplier becomes insolvent, it can have a negative effect on your business’ credit score. If you have credit accounts with them, it’s worth monitoring their credit rating to mitigate this risk.\n\n__- Don’t neglect your personal credit score:__ Credit bureaus may use the personal financial information of owners when startups or small businesses have a short credit history. If this is the case, you’ll want to ensure that your own credit score is as high as possible.

Even if you haven’t received any suspicious calls, you could still be vulnerable. There are several techniques criminals use to steal sensitive data from mobile devices. Here’s how you can stay safe:\n\n### Protect yourself when using public Wi-Fi connections\nIdentity thieves can use unsecured public Wi-Fi to steal information from connected devices. Security experts advise that it is always safer to use your mobile data. If you do need to connect to public Wi-Fi though, remember that password-protected networks are more secure. Also, avoid making purchases or using online or mobile banking over public networks. VPN (virtual private network) apps and software can offer an extra layer of protection for your online activity if you frequently rely on Wi-Fi hotspots. \n\n### Password protect your device\nSet a strong passcode on your mobile device so your information doesn’t fall into the wrong hands if your phone is lost or stolen. Use a long PIN or passcode pattern to make it difficult for fraudsters to unlock your device. Biometric features like fingerprint detectors also offer high levels of security. Remember to always lock your smartphone when it’s not in use, and set it to automatically lock when you turn it off or after a certain period of time.\n\n### Encrypt your data and be prepared to wipe it\nMost mobile devices have encrypted data by default. If yours doesn’t, it’s a good idea to change this within your settings. You should also back up your mobile data by storing its settings on a cloud service or syncing it with your PC or Mac device. This way, if your phone is stolen, you can remotely wipe your data without losing your contacts, apps, and files. Set up remote wipe, so you’re able to erase your phone’s content if it’s stolen. Remote wipe features may also help you to track the location of your device.\n\n### Be wary of suspicious texts and apps\nCriminals can use unsolicited texts and illegitimate apps to steal your data. If you receive a text from a source you don’t recognise, do not click on any links, as they may be a [phishing scam](https://brex.com/learn/fraud-security/what-is-phishing-scam/). Criminals may also use fake banking apps to download [malware](https://brex.com/learn/fraud-security/what-is-malware/) onto your device to track you and steal your information. Only use the App Store and Google Play when downloading apps, or conduct thorough research when using third-party apps to ensure they are legitimate.\n\n### Perform regular updates \nRegularly updating your mobile device’s operating system will help keep your device secure. Don’t ignore update reminders. If you need to, charge your phone and clear some memory to install the latest updates.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"2qFcy7TutIXLFU1Ie1iiNC","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-10T20:58:13.314Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-10T20:58:13.314Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"fourStepTile"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"articleLinks":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"4M1CiZUz87f5EaIoUhEDjM","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-20T20:04:01.717Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-09T08:47:43.494Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":15,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"articleHeader"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"category":"fraud-security","thumbnailImage":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"1X0ycJRIUfg5XwoRE4KkFW","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2019-09-24T19:12:50.961Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-30T22:39:00.593Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Thumbnail,

Fraudsters may steal personally identifiable information by breaking into systems with old security systems or by hijacking public Wi-Fi networks. \n\nThey can use these details to make fraudulent purchases online. The merchant may be held liable for the unauthorized transaction and can also lose out on any merchandise they ship. \n\n### Friendly fraud\nCybercriminals don’t always use other people’s details to commit payment fraud. Friendly fraud is when a customer makes a digital transaction with their own credit card. They will then contact their credit card issuer to claim the item was lost or damaged, the transaction was unauthorized, or the merchant failed to issue a refund on the returned order.\n\nFriendly fraud allows fraudsters to exploit [credit card protection](https://brex.com/learn/fraud-security/credit-card-protection/) to receive a chargeback from the issuer. Not only does the merchant lose out on payment and merchandise, but they may be penalized by the issuer as well. \n\n### Clean fraud\nClean fraud transactions can be very difficult to distinguish from legitimate purchases. Criminals will use stolen credit card details but have a lot of knowledge about the cardholder’s identity. They then use the victim’s real customer data to trick online fraud detection systems. Many fraudsters will make cheap purchases with the stolen credit card data to test that they can successfully deceive the fraud detection systems.  \n### Pagejacking\nHackers can exploit weaknesses in a website’s security to facilitate the theft of sensitive data. One way they do this is by hijacking a part of the site. Visitors are then unknowingly directed to a different URL. \n\nFrom there, they can ask users to input sensitive data into legitimate-looking forms. They may also download [malware](https://brex.com/learn/fraud-security/what-is-malware/) onto the customer’s device. This malicious software can track browser activity and keystrokes to collect data or even encrypt files to demand a ransom. \n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"4En5M4kStqql2Un7aKG8SN","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-10T20:27:10.165Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-10T20:27:10.165Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"How to reduce the risk of payment fraud"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"Ln2Tjx7fh41ac2VLtCro0","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-10T20:27:26.301Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-10T20:27:26.301Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"There are several steps businesses can take to protect themselves and their customers.

They can also ensure merchants are not liable for fraudulent payments.  \n\nProtect customer data by requiring users to set strong passwords and regularly update their login details. It’s also a good idea to encourage customers to log into their account to complete a purchase. You should always encrypt emails and transactions that contain confidential customer details. You should also encourage users to use two-factor authentication, such as an authenticator app or SMS.\n\nAs cybercriminals are always adapting their methods, online business owners should maintain awareness of trends in payment fraud. Being knowledgeable about the latest risks allows you to stay one step ahead of fraudsters.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"7g9peCgUCbis9Pkk88bXzK","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-10T20:28:43.407Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-10T20:28:43.407Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"fourStepTile"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"articleLinks":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"6njgXoLWYERZgZoKDE2VJI","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-10T19:01:39.695Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-10T19:01:39.695Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"articleHeader"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"category":"fraud-security","thumbnailImage":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"4DNET9LpCPSu8iWE5AyVyU","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2019-10-10T19:00:15.867Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-10T19:00:15.867Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Thumbnail-virtual-card","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lrdkz6qgi9tt/4DNET9LpCPSu8iWE5AyVyU/8d60e05e2110ef70eb57a8e54f882e92/Thumbnail-virtual-card.png","details":{"size":61724,"image":{"width":273,"height":273}},"fileName":"Thumbnail-virtual-card.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"urlPath":"how-virtual-credit-card-works","title":"How

But the fraudster can use the card details to make purchases online.\n\n### Card-not-present fraud\n\nThis type of fraud does not require the criminal to have a physical credit card. Instead, they will obtain basic details, such as the account holder's name, the credit card number, and the expiration date. With this information, they can commit fraudulent activity by mail, via the phone, or online.\n\n### Counterfeit, doctored or faked cards\n\nDevices known as skimmers can illegally obtain credit card details. These machines capture information from the credit card's magnetic strip, which the criminal can then encode into a counterfeited, faked, or doctored card. It might be hard to detect the difference between a regular card reader or ATM and one with a skimmer attached to it. (Make sure you feel the card reader to see if it’s loose or abnormal, just in case.)\n\n### Application fraud\n\nRather than stealing existing credit card details, a criminal may instead apply for new credit in someone else's name. They do this by using the victim's personal information, such as their full name, date of birth, address and Social Security Number. They may even steal supporting documentation to substantiate their application.\n\n### Account takeover\n\nAfter gaining personal information, a fraudster can then contact their credit card company and pretend to be the account holder by presenting information like previous purchases, passwords and card details. This is sometimes referred to as “social engineering.”\n\nThey will do this to register a change of address and then report the card as lost or stolen to get a new card sent out through the mail.\n\n### Intercepting cards in the mail\n\nIf a credit card company sends out a new or replacement card via post, then a criminal may be able to intercept the package or steal it from the account holder’s mailbox. This is why most card issuers will use unmarked letters and packaging when sending cards."}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"4Ubbfk9fmCd4n530mvIG7v","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-20T23:46:18.261Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-20T23:46:18.261Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"How to identify credit card fraud"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"7sEkK9EwYGPAObzoib70Dv","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-20T23:46:05.774Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-20T23:48:36.792Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Credit card fraud is the most common type of identity theft.

Regularly checking your credit report to see if anything appears unfamiliar, such as new credit searches and inquiries, the opening of new accounts, or the registration of unknown addresses.\n3. Reviewing bills and invoices to ensure you are not receiving correspondence and collection notices for unfamiliar accounts. You can also use your credit report to check if you are on any collection agencies’ lists, as most report debts to credit bureaus.\n\nMany credit card companies offer additional protection in the form of identity theft monitoring services.These services alert you to any changes in your credit report, suspicious activity on your credit account, or instances of your stolen information appearing on the internet.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"4MSj7z1r9PwX09t4vAOjnz","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-20T23:48:53.572Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-20T23:48:53.572Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"What to do if you become a victim of credit card fraud"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"36o3Bmjae6c7rPoSkZkoqc","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-20T23:49:22.032Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-14T18:52:36.530Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Regardless of the extent of the charges accrued by criminals, U.S. federal law limits the account holder’s liability to just $50.
