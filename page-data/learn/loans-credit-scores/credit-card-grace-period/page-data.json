New purchases may not be subject to a grace period if you carry a balance forward from the previous billing cycle. The billing cycle must start with a $0 balance to be subject to the grace period.\n\nIf you only make minimum payments, you could pay interest on both the unpaid balance and new purchases. Interest on new purchases may accrue immediately for credit card accounts with an outstanding balance. Your credit card issuer may also charge additional fees.\n\nThese charges will accrue until the balance is paid off in full, at which point the grace period will once again apply to new purchases. To get the most from your grace period, make sure you clear your balance in full by the due date each billing cycle.\n\nDepending on their type, grace periods exclude some transactions. [Cash advances](https://brex.com/learn/corporate-card/credit-card-cash-advance/) can start accruing interest immediately and may be subject to several additional fees. Balance transfers are also unlikely to come with a grace period unless they are part of a 0% promotional offer. Pay off a transaction as soon as possible to reduce the interest you pay if it falls outside of your grace period terms. \n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"1wdVSD4VRvv6BzSb3eOwTB","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-22T23:29:34.789Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-22T23:29:34.789Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"How long is a credit card grace period?"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"TZGReqEljHrVGPr3c4fZh","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-22T23:29:50.485Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-22T23:29:50.485Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Before the Federal Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009 came into effect, issuers could start charging interest on purchases straight away.
