Making payments reduces your outstanding balance and improves your utilization ratio. It’s also a good idea to check when your issuer reports your information to the major credit bureaus. If your monthly payment date is after this time, pay earlier or make multiple payments per billing cycle. This shows the credit bureaus you are clearing your balance each month.  \n\nMany issuers offer balance alerts. These can be handy reminders to make regular monthly payments. They can also notify you if your balance exceeds a set amount, helping you to avoid overspending.\n\nAnother way to improve your credit utilization ratio is by increasing your credit limit. You can do this by requesting that your issuer increases your existing credit limit. They are more likely to increase your limit if you have proven you are a responsible borrower who makes payments on time. Make sure you do not start spending more on the account as a result of a higher limit. \n\nYou can also improve your overall utilization ratio by applying for a new credit account. Remember that credit checks appear on your credit report, so making multiple credit inquiries can cause your credit score to dip in the short term.\n\nWhen you pay off a credit account, it’s worth keeping it open, even if you don’t need it anymore. [Cancelling a credit](https://brex.com/learn/corporate-card/how-to-cancel-credit-card/) card lowers your total available credit and can increase your utilization ratio.
