This percentage represents the annual interest rate that a lender charges over the term of a credit agreement. Along with the interest rate, APR also includes any applicable fees, such as origination fees on loans.\n\nUnderstanding how lenders calculate and apply APR to transactions can give you a clearer picture of the price you’ll pay for borrowing.

They calculate this on a daily or monthly periodic rate, with different rates of interest applying for various transaction types. \n\nYou can work out how much interest is due on your balance by dividing the APR by 365 (the number of days in the year) to calculate your daily periodic rate (DPR). The credit issuer will multiply your current balance by the DPR to determine the daily interest charge. This interest is then compounded until you repay the outstanding balance in full.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"1CS0OQkdH5EkSe3YDGjLjW","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-11-14T16:51:55.202Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-14T16:51:55.202Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"smallerImage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"smallerImage":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"G4ekGsmMFM7CmBSgd8QKS","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2019-11-14T16:51:42.214Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-14T16:51:42.214Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Brex-LearningCenter-APR","description":"what is apr","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lrdkz6qgi9tt/G4ekGsmMFM7CmBSgd8QKS/3a8ab8c9cbcd236de18ae4929ac9c9a5/LearningCenter.APR.01.png","details":{"size":21306,"image":{"width":914,"height":514}},"fileName":"LearningCenter.APR.01.png","contentType":"image/png"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"5ieCdkEBguNOaFPHkZtT2E","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-22T23:37:57.417Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-22T23:37:57.417Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Variable APR vs fixed APR"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"5TP6vhE7Uz6YWTr6uWbPwh","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-22T23:37:49.208Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-22T23:37:49.208Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Most credit cards will have a variable APR.

For example, if the prime rate is 4% and the lender’s margin is 14%, your APR will be 18%. The prime rate is the lowest APR that lenders can charge their most creditworthy borrowers.\n\nIt is rare for credit cards to have fixed interest rates. A fixed APR means that the rate of interest remains the same despite changes in the market. Lenders can change their fixed APR, but they must give written notice and changes cannot be applied retrospectively. \n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"1NlqDFna5ksE5CNSb9ACWb","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-22T23:38:12.918Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-22T23:38:12.918Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"The different APRs that apply to credit cards"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"3ELIg8kizvu0dECKtoGg44","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-22T23:38:53.140Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-22T23:40:14.998Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Different APRs can apply to the same credit card, depending on transaction types and promotional offers.

This includes exceeding the [credit limit](https://brex.com/learn/loans-credit-scores/what-is-credit-limit/) or multiple late payments.
