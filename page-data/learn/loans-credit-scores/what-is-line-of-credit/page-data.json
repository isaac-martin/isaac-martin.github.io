The first distinction is that LOCs will typically have lower APRs than credit cards, making them a less costly form of financing. \n\nIt is also much easier and more affordable to take out cash advances with a line of credit than with a credit card. \n\nThe LOC issuer will typically provide the account holder with a checkbook and credit card for purchases, payments, or cash withdrawals. In contrast, cash advances from credit cards have high interest rates and will usually incur expensive fees.\n\nUnlike a term loan, LOCs allow you to draw funds when necessary. And unlike credit cards, you won’t usually be required to make monthly payments. \n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the lifespan of a line of credit is shorter than that of a credit card. LOCs tend only to be open for a period of a few years, while credit cards can be maintained indefinitely.

Making small purchases with a LOC and meeting the repayments on time can help to boost a company’s creditworthiness. A higher credit score makes it more likely that lenders will accept a company’s credit applications and offer them more competitive rates. It also shows vendors, suppliers and other business partners that the company is likely to reliably meet repayments. \n\nAs they tend to have higher interest rates than term loans, LOCs are usually not ideal for funding larger purchases.

The major difference between these types of LOCs is whether or not any collateral is required. \n\n### Secured Lines of Credit\nA secured line of credit requires the account holder to provide a valuable asset as collateral for the credit they receive. The collateral will need to match or exceed the value of the LOC’s maximum limit and can come in the form of the company, its property, or equipment. \n\nSecured LOCs tend to offer higher credit limits and more competitive interest rates, as providing collateral mitigates the risk that the lender takes by extending the line of credit.\n\nIf a business defaults on payments and the lender seizes assets to recoup its losses, a secured loan allows the borrower to designate assets for possession.\n\n### Unsecured Lines of Credit\nAn unsecured line of credit does not require the borrower to provide any form of collateral. These are best suited to businesses seeking smaller credit limits up to around $100,000, as they tend to have lower maximum limits and higher interest rates. \n\nLenders can still seize personal assets for outstanding payments on unsecured business LOCs if the company is unable to provide the funds.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"7hRBLXKACqCfrA3IIY5YnI","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-21T23:25:58.230Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-21T23:25:58.230Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Qualifying For a Business Line of Credit"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"40zyHhaXkDbT8HfZxWSU7Z","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-21T23:26:13.032Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-21T23:26:13.032Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Lenders base interest rates, repayment terms, and maximum credit limits on several factors, including the business’ credit score, financial history, and revenue.\n\nTo qualify for a business line of credit, a company owner will typically need to provide evidence that they have at least $50,000 or more in annual revenue, one year in business, and a personal credit score of 550 or above.\n\nHowever, businesses with a lower credit score or less credit history may still be able to qualify for a short-term line of credit.
