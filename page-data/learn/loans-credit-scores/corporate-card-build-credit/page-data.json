This is because the balance and payment information of a corporate credit card is reported under the business and not the individual holders.\n\nDifferent corporate credit cards will have different terms. Some cards will only make a business responsible for repaying charges. Others will have joint liability with all authorized holders. In this instance, corporate credit card activity could appear on a user’s report if a debt becomes delinquent.\n\nIf you’re the primary account holder of a small business credit card, then the effects will be similar to a personal credit card. You’re offering a personal guarantee of repayment on all debts on that credit card. The issuer will carry out credit checks before approval and report payment information to the major credit bureaus.\n\nAuthorized users of small business credit cards could also see their credit affected by its activity. If the credit account is managed responsibly, then all named holders could see improvements to their credit. Conversely, poor management can negatively impact all cardholders’ credit histories and scores.
