These include your credit score, current financial situation, the amount of debt you have, and your repayment history. According to previous research by Experian, the average credit card limit in the USA is just above $8,000. Lenders will issue low credit limits if they determine you’re a higher financial risk.\n\nAvailable credit is not the same as a credit limit. Your credit limit remains the same however much you borrow. Your available credit is affected by how much you have already spent.

They calculate this on a daily or monthly periodic rate, with different rates of interest applying for various transaction types. \n\nYou can work out how much interest is due on your balance by dividing the APR by 365 (the number of days in the year) to calculate your daily periodic rate (DPR). The credit issuer will multiply your current balance by the DPR to determine the daily interest charge. This interest is then compounded until you repay the outstanding balance in full.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"1CS0OQkdH5EkSe3YDGjLjW","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-11-14T16:51:55.202Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-14T16:51:55.202Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"smallerImage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"smallerImage":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"G4ekGsmMFM7CmBSgd8QKS","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2019-11-14T16:51:42.214Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-14T16:51:42.214Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Brex-LearningCenter-APR","description":"what is apr","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lrdkz6qgi9tt/G4ekGsmMFM7CmBSgd8QKS/3a8ab8c9cbcd236de18ae4929ac9c9a5/LearningCenter.APR.01.png","details":{"size":21306,"image":{"width":914,"height":514}},"fileName":"LearningCenter.APR.01.png","contentType":"image/png"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"5ieCdkEBguNOaFPHkZtT2E","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-22T23:37:57.417Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-22T23:37:57.417Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Variable APR vs fixed APR"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"5TP6vhE7Uz6YWTr6uWbPwh","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-22T23:37:49.208Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-22T23:37:49.208Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Most credit cards will have a variable APR.

Make sure you do not start spending more on the account as a result of a higher limit. \n\nYou can also improve your overall utilization ratio by applying for a new credit account.

But there are several steps you can take to try to improve it if your business credit score isn’t as high as you’d like.\nYou can keep your score looking healthy by providing accurate and up-to-date information, responsibly managing your finances, and regularly reviewing your report. Here are some steps you can take to help give your business credit score a boost:\n\n__- Make payments on time or early:__Your business credit score takes your company’s payment history into account. Always make credit repayments on time or before they are due. Remember that [net terms](https://brex.com/learn/corporate-card/what-are-net-payment-terms/) are also a form of credit, so falling behind on these can also harm your score.\n__- Bring your credit utilization ratio down__: A credit utilization ratio measures the difference between the amount of credit available to your business and the amount that has been used. It’s recommended that you use less than 15% of your available credit. You can bring this ratio down by clearing balances, decreasing spending on your credit account, and increasing your overall credit limit. \n__- Avoid making multiple credit applications:__ Credit checks from lenders on your business appear on your credit report. Multiple credit applications in a short period can be an indication of financial difficulties. \n\n__- Regularly review your credit report:__ You can ensure all the information is accurate and up-to-date by keeping an eye on your credit reports. You can dispute inaccuracies and identify any unfamiliar inquiries or credit applications. This can be a sign of fraudulent activity, and you should [report it](https://brex.com/learn/fraud-security/report-credit-card-fraud/) to the credit bureau immediately. \n\n__- Ask suppliers to share data:__ If you have a good payment relationship with a supplier or vendor, you can request they provide data to the credit bureaus. The more positive feedback on your company’s payment performance, the better your credit score is likely to be. \n\n__- Check your suppliers’ credit:__ If a supplier becomes insolvent, it can have a negative effect on your business’ credit score. If you have credit accounts with them, it’s worth monitoring their credit rating to mitigate this risk.\n\n__- Don’t neglect your personal credit score:__ Credit bureaus may use the personal financial information of owners when startups or small businesses have a short credit history. If this is the case, you’ll want to ensure that your own credit score is as high as possible.
