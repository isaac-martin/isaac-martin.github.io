But the fraudster can use the card details to make purchases online.\n\n### Card-not-present fraud\n\nThis type of fraud does not require the criminal to have a physical credit card. Instead, they will obtain basic details, such as the account holder's name, the credit card number, and the expiration date. With this information, they can commit fraudulent activity by mail, via the phone, or online.\n\n### Counterfeit, doctored or faked cards\n\nDevices known as skimmers can illegally obtain credit card details. These machines capture information from the credit card's magnetic strip, which the criminal can then encode into a counterfeited, faked, or doctored card. It might be hard to detect the difference between a regular card reader or ATM and one with a skimmer attached to it. (Make sure you feel the card reader to see if it’s loose or abnormal, just in case.)\n\n### Application fraud\n\nRather than stealing existing credit card details, a criminal may instead apply for new credit in someone else's name. They do this by using the victim's personal information, such as their full name, date of birth, address and Social Security Number. They may even steal supporting documentation to substantiate their application.\n\n### Account takeover\n\nAfter gaining personal information, a fraudster can then contact their credit card company and pretend to be the account holder by presenting information like previous purchases, passwords and card details. This is sometimes referred to as “social engineering.”\n\nThey will do this to register a change of address and then report the card as lost or stolen to get a new card sent out through the mail.\n\n### Intercepting cards in the mail\n\nIf a credit card company sends out a new or replacement card via post, then a criminal may be able to intercept the package or steal it from the account holder’s mailbox. This is why most card issuers will use unmarked letters and packaging when sending cards."}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"4Ubbfk9fmCd4n530mvIG7v","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-20T23:46:18.261Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-20T23:46:18.261Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"How to identify credit card fraud"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"7sEkK9EwYGPAObzoib70Dv","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-20T23:46:05.774Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-20T23:48:36.792Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Credit card fraud is the most common type of identity theft.

Never share them with sources you can’t verify over the phone.\nBut even if you take all the necessary steps to avoid becoming a target of fraud, remain vigilant by regularly checking for any suspicious activity. You can detect fraud by:\n\n\n1. Reviewing monthly credit card statements in detail to identify any unauthorized transactions.\n2. Regularly checking your credit report to see if anything appears unfamiliar, such as new credit searches and inquiries, the opening of new accounts, or the registration of unknown addresses.\n3. Reviewing bills and invoices to ensure you are not receiving correspondence and collection notices for unfamiliar accounts. You can also use your credit report to check if you are on any collection agencies’ lists, as most report debts to credit bureaus.\n\nMany credit card companies offer additional protection in the form of identity theft monitoring services.These services alert you to any changes in your credit report, suspicious activity on your credit account, or instances of your stolen information appearing on the internet.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"4MSj7z1r9PwX09t4vAOjnz","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-20T23:48:53.572Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-20T23:48:53.572Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"What to do if you become a victim of credit card fraud"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"36o3Bmjae6c7rPoSkZkoqc","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-20T23:49:22.032Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-14T18:52:36.530Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Regardless of the extent of the charges accrued by criminals, U.S. federal law limits the account holder’s liability to just $50.
