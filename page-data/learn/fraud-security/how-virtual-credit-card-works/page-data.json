You can usually lock or delete them with a click if they become compromised. \n\nWhen a physical credit card becomes lost, stolen or compromised, the account holder has to cancel it, wait for a new one to be issued, and then enter a dispute process. With a virtual card, the cancellation process is much more straightforward. Upon cancellation, the account holder can maintain access to their credit account through their physical card.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"kHbKDDYhUgRzPv12VTjS7","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-10T18:52:20.121Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-10T18:52:20.121Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Things to Consider When Getting a Virtual Credit Card"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"4MXqpGKwp4apuyz5CD1TbY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-10T18:52:38.888Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-10T18:52:38.888Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Virtual credit cards arenâ€™t entirely fraud-proof. It is still important that users remain vigilant with their credit accounts, checking their statements regularly for any unauthorized transactions. \n\nVirtual credit cards are also designed specifically for online and card-not-present transactions. These are transactions where the merchant does not see the physical credit card used for the purchase. Examples include electronic, mobile, telephone and mail order transactions. \n\nThe process of returning items could also be more difficult. Many merchants require the same card number to process refunds. If you used virtual credit card details for the purchase, and these have since expired, then you may not be able to receive a monetary reimbursement and will have to accept store credit instead.\n\nThere could also be complications when using virtual credit cards for transactions that require verification at a later stage, such as car rentals or hotel bookings. As the virtual and physical credit card numbers would not match, this could cause issues for the merchant when verifying that the transaction came from the same credit account.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"4UYYXy227M7L13kOjl2Nhr","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-10T18:52:58.747Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-10T18:52:58.747Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"How to Get a Virtual Credit Card"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"12Ew4hvQ9uL1FTklUVJDqo","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-10T18:54:48.100Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-10T18:54:48.100Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Brex gives you instant access to your [virtual corporate credit card](https://brex.com/solution/virtual-card/) upon approval.
