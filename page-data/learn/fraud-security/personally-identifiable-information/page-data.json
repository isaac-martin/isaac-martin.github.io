IGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force across the EU in 2018. This change to EU law sets out new guidelines for the collection of personal information for all citizens in the 28 EU member states. \n\nGDPR recognises “online identifiers” as personal data, including elements such as IP addresses and cookies. It states that these online identifiers, “may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them”.\n\nUS organizations are also recognizing online data as PII. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stated: “we regard data as ‘personally identifiable’, and thus warranting privacy protections when it can be reasonably linked to a particular person, computer or device. In many cases, persistent identifiers such as device identifiers, MAC addresses, static IP addresses, or cookies meet this test”.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"7avgatb73RDnMf9zIeNEpv","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-22T21:27:30.290Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-22T21:27:30.290Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"How to keep your PII secure"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"6FwFqqZM4StsLjjHv2RUxx","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-22T21:28:25.127Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-22T21:28:25.127Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Always exercise caution when anyone requests your PII.

If you’re unsure, contact your bank or credit card issuer directly.\n\nYou can protect your device from malicious programs like [malware](https://brex.com/learn/fraud-security/what-is-malware/) by keeping your antivirus software up to date. Malicious programs can track your online activity and keystrokes to steal sensitive information. Criminals can also use unsecured Wi-Fi networks to obtain your details, so avoid connecting to them if possible. You can also use VPN technology to encrypt your data. \n\nEnsure you use strong passwords and security questions that criminals can’t easily guess. Criminals might also use details on social media sites. Your social media profiles can contain linkable PII, such as your workplace, home city, and where you went to school. \n\nThey can also provide answers to common security questions, such as your pet’s name or where you met your partner. Make your profiles private and set up two-factor authentication to keep your accounts secure.\n\nRegularly monitor your bank and credit card statements, as well as your credit reports for unauthorized activity. This can include unfamiliar transactions or applications for credit. If you spot anything suspicious, report it immediately to your card issuer. You should also contact one of the three major credit bureaus to dispute any inaccurate information and set up a fraud alert.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"2WMTaXUc6wCleg99Dm7Rv","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-22T21:31:42.049Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-22T21:31:42.049Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"fourStepTile"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"articleLinks":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"2je2lx9SPbM6qdEBCkqb8t","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-10T20:59:49.826Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-10T20:59:49.826Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"articleHeader"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"category":"fraud-security","thumbnailImage":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"6VGhEXjNnjsJtH6sQ4etUV","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2019-10-10T20:59:43.960Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-10T20:59:43.960Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Thumbnail-credit-card-phone","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lrdkz6qgi9tt/6VGhEXjNnjsJtH6sQ4etUV/71d41069a7d96de8c6f4445121d500a9/Thumbnail-credit-card-phone.png","details":{"size":64239,"image":{"width":273,"height":273}},"fileName":"Thumbnail-credit-card-phone.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"urlPath":"what-information-over-phone","title":"What
