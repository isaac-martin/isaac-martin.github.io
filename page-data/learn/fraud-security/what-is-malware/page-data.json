Around half of all cases of credit card fraud are committed using malware. \n\nThis can include spyware, ransomware, computer viruses, and cryptoworms, such as the WannaCry attack in 2017. Targeting computers with a Microsoft Windows operating system, WannaCry encrypted data and demanded ransom payments for their decryption. This attack affected over 200,000 devices in 150 countries. \n\nCriminals may use your personal information to commit identity fraud or sell it on to other criminals once they have it.

Fraudsters send unsolicited emails that appear to be from a reliable source, such as a credit card company or bank. These emails will include links to domains that mimic legitimate websites. When someone clicks on these links, they will be asked to input sensitive details, or malware will be unknowingly downloaded on their device. \n\nSpyware may be one form of malware that is downloaded onto a victim’s device. This can run in the background while the victim goes about their usual activities. The software can monitor and track a variety of information to collect sensitive information. \n\nRansomware is another common form of malware software. As the name suggests, in the case of ransomware attacks, cybercriminals obtain sensitive data and demand a ransom for the individual or corporation to regain access. Criminals will often request that these ransoms be paid using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, as they are anonymous and untraceable."}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"7gEY0dhBDc97KaJB8miQSw","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-20T20:00:16.394Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-20T20:00:16.394Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Examples of malware and how they work"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"6lFuMKG7mHZQ85u3sdLB0p","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-20T20:02:10.101Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-23T22:55:13.429Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"\n1. __Phising scam:__ criminals send legitimate-looking emails with links that collect sensitive information or unknowingly download malware software.\n2. __Spyware__: This software runs in the background of a device, monitoring online activity and keystrokes to steal information.\n3. __Ransomware:__ Criminals steal sensitive data and files and demand the vicitm pays a ransom to regain access to them.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"6ToaL4muYLvRylkQFNRMeX","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-20T20:02:26.141Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-20T20:02:26.141Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Victims can face serious financial repercussions regardless of the ransomware the fraudster uses.
