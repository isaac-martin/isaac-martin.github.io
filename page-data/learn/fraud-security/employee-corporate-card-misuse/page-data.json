Issuers usually have minimum requirements of 15 cardholders, but it’s a good idea to limit the number as much as possible. Only employees who make frequent business transactions need one, and they should never give them to anyone else.\n\nCommunicate corporate credit card policy clearly to all employees. They should understand which transactions are authorised and how much they can spend each month. Outline the consequences for misuse and be clear that those in violation may be dismissed and prosecuted.\n\nYou can reduce misuse by setting [spending limits](https://brex.com/learn/corporate-card/set-corporate-card-limit/)and restrictions on expense categories. Corporate credit card issuers allow you to set terms for each employee so they only have access to the funds they need.\n\nChoosing corporate credit cards with joint [liability](https://brex.com/learn/corporate-card/who-is-liable-corporate-card/) encourage employee accountability. Employees are responsible for paying credit card transactions themselves. The company then reimburses them upon the submitting and reviewal of expense reports. Make sure employees include original receipts and submit expense reports by a monthly deadline.\n\nOrganizations can identify suspicious activity by regularly reviewing corporate credit card usage. Credit card issuers may also offer to notify the company and set alerts of unusual or substantial transactions.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"2jgXXIt5DufFjVGc6vcnLb","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-20T18:27:03.494Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-20T18:27:03.494Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"What to do if you suspect misuse of credit cards"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"53aBbUmkWIyFmGUeuf0Eur","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-20T18:27:07.185Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-20T18:27:07.185Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Even when companies have taken all the preventative steps, corporate credit card misuse can still happen. If you suspect an employee is violating the terms of their corporate credit card, act fast. \n\nCheck statements, receipts, and expense reports for regular violations. Remember that a one-off incident may just be a misunderstanding or accident, so be open-minded and fair in your approach. If these confirm your suspicions, immediately suspend or cancel the credit card. \n\nGather any documentation you need to conduct an investigation, including statements, receipts, and a ‘back-end’ card transaction report from the credit card issuer. This confirms the point of sale and PIN usage on transactions. It can challenge any claims by the employee that the card was lost, stolen, or skimmed.  \n\nYou may decide to launch an internal investigation for smaller incidents of misconduct. If the company has insufficient resources or the investigation is against a senior member of staff, it may be worth hiring an external investigator. If the fraudulent activity is more serious, report it to the police.
