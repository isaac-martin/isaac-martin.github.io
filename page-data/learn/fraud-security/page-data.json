Even if you haven’t received any suspicious calls, you could still be vulnerable. There are several techniques criminals use to steal sensitive data from mobile devices. Here’s how you can stay safe:\n\n### Protect yourself when using public Wi-Fi connections\nIdentity thieves can use unsecured public Wi-Fi to steal information from connected devices. Security experts advise that it is always safer to use your mobile data. If you do need to connect to public Wi-Fi though, remember that password-protected networks are more secure. Also, avoid making purchases or using online or mobile banking over public networks. VPN (virtual private network) apps and software can offer an extra layer of protection for your online activity if you frequently rely on Wi-Fi hotspots. \n\n### Password protect your device\nSet a strong passcode on your mobile device so your information doesn’t fall into the wrong hands if your phone is lost or stolen. Use a long PIN or passcode pattern to make it difficult for fraudsters to unlock your device. Biometric features like fingerprint detectors also offer high levels of security. Remember to always lock your smartphone when it’s not in use, and set it to automatically lock when you turn it off or after a certain period of time.\n\n### Encrypt your data and be prepared to wipe it\nMost mobile devices have encrypted data by default. If yours doesn’t, it’s a good idea to change this within your settings. You should also back up your mobile data by storing its settings on a cloud service or syncing it with your PC or Mac device. This way, if your phone is stolen, you can remotely wipe your data without losing your contacts, apps, and files. Set up remote wipe, so you’re able to erase your phone’s content if it’s stolen. Remote wipe features may also help you to track the location of your device.\n\n### Be wary of suspicious texts and apps\nCriminals can use unsolicited texts and illegitimate apps to steal your data. If you receive a text from a source you don’t recognise, do not click on any links, as they may be a [phishing scam](https://brex.com/learn/fraud-security/what-is-phishing-scam/). Criminals may also use fake banking apps to download [malware](https://brex.com/learn/fraud-security/what-is-malware/) onto your device to track you and steal your information. Only use the App Store and Google Play when downloading apps, or conduct thorough research when using third-party apps to ensure they are legitimate.\n\n### Perform regular updates \nRegularly updating your mobile device’s operating system will help keep your device secure.

Fraudsters may steal personally identifiable information by breaking into systems with old security systems or by hijacking public Wi-Fi networks. \n\nThey can use these details to make fraudulent purchases online. The merchant may be held liable for the unauthorized transaction and can also lose out on any merchandise they ship. \n\n### Friendly fraud\nCybercriminals don’t always use other people’s details to commit payment fraud. Friendly fraud is when a customer makes a digital transaction with their own credit card. They will then contact their credit card issuer to claim the item was lost or damaged, the transaction was unauthorized, or the merchant failed to issue a refund on the returned order.\n\nFriendly fraud allows fraudsters to exploit [credit card protection](https://brex.com/learn/fraud-security/credit-card-protection/) to receive a chargeback from the issuer. Not only does the merchant lose out on payment and merchandise, but they may be penalized by the issuer as well. \n\n### Clean fraud\nClean fraud transactions can be very difficult to distinguish from legitimate purchases. Criminals will use stolen credit card details but have a lot of knowledge about the cardholder’s identity. They then use the victim’s real customer data to trick online fraud detection systems. Many fraudsters will make cheap purchases with the stolen credit card data to test that they can successfully deceive the fraud detection systems.  \n### Pagejacking\nHackers can exploit weaknesses in a website’s security to facilitate the theft of sensitive data. One way they do this is by hijacking a part of the site. Visitors are then unknowingly directed to a different URL. \n\nFrom there, they can ask users to input sensitive data into legitimate-looking forms. They may also download [malware](https://brex.com/learn/fraud-security/what-is-malware/) onto the customer’s device. This malicious software can track browser activity and keystrokes to collect data or even encrypt files to demand a ransom. \n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"4En5M4kStqql2Un7aKG8SN","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-10T20:27:10.165Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-10T20:27:10.165Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"How to reduce the risk of payment fraud"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"Ln2Tjx7fh41ac2VLtCro0","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-10T20:27:26.301Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-10T20:27:26.301Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"There are several steps businesses can take to protect themselves and their customers. Antivirus software and firewalls offer identity theft protection against cybercriminals. Ensure these are constantly up to date to keep your sensitive details secure. \n\nYou can also reduce the risk of fraudulent payments by partnering with a verified payment gateway, like Verified by Visa. These gateways provide an additional layer of security before the authorization of ecommerce transactions. They can also ensure merchants are not liable for fraudulent payments.  \n\nProtect customer data by requiring users to set strong passwords and regularly update their login details. It’s also a good idea to encourage customers to log into their account to complete a purchase. You should always encrypt emails and transactions that contain confidential customer details. You should also encourage users to use two-factor authentication, such as an authenticator app or SMS.\n\nAs cybercriminals are always adapting their methods, online business owners should maintain awareness of trends in payment fraud. Being knowledgeable about the latest risks allows you to stay one step ahead of fraudsters.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"7g9peCgUCbis9Pkk88bXzK","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-10T20:28:43.407Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-10T20:28:43.407Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"fourStepTile"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"articleLinks":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"6njgXoLWYERZgZoKDE2VJI","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-10T19:01:39.695Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-10T19:01:39.695Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"articleHeader"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"category":"fraud-security","thumbnailImage":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"4DNET9LpCPSu8iWE5AyVyU","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2019-10-10T19:00:15.867Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-10T19:00:15.867Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Thumbnail-virtual-card","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lrdkz6qgi9tt/4DNET9LpCPSu8iWE5AyVyU/8d60e05e2110ef70eb57a8e54f882e92/Thumbnail-virtual-card.png","details":{"size":61724,"image":{"width":273,"height":273}},"fileName":"Thumbnail-virtual-card.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"urlPath":"how-virtual-credit-card-works","title":"How

Examples include electronic, mobile, telephone and mail order transactions. \n\nThe process of returning items could also be more difficult. Many merchants require the same card number to process refunds.

Fraudsters send unsolicited emails that appear to be from a reliable source, such as a credit card company or bank. These emails will include links to domains that mimic legitimate websites.

This can run in the background while the victim goes about their usual activities. The software can monitor and track a variety of information to collect sensitive information. \n\nRansomware is another common form of malware software.

But the fraudster can use the card details to make purchases online.\n\n### Card-not-present fraud\n\nThis type of fraud does not require the criminal to have a physical credit card. Instead, they will obtain basic details, such as the account holder's name, the credit card number, and the expiration date. With this information, they can commit fraudulent activity by mail, via the phone, or online.\n\n### Counterfeit, doctored or faked cards\n\nDevices known as skimmers can illegally obtain credit card details. These machines capture information from the credit card's magnetic strip, which the criminal can then encode into a counterfeited, faked, or doctored card. It might be hard to detect the difference between a regular card reader or ATM and one with a skimmer attached to it. (Make sure you feel the card reader to see if it’s loose or abnormal, just in case.)\n\n### Application fraud\n\nRather than stealing existing credit card details, a criminal may instead apply for new credit in someone else's name. They do this by using the victim's personal information, such as their full name, date of birth, address and Social Security Number. They may even steal supporting documentation to substantiate their application.\n\n### Account takeover\n\nAfter gaining personal information, a fraudster can then contact their credit card company and pretend to be the account holder by presenting information like previous purchases, passwords and card details. This is sometimes referred to as “social engineering.”\n\nThey will do this to register a change of address and then report the card as lost or stolen to get a new card sent out through the mail.\n\n### Intercepting cards in the mail\n\nIf a credit card company sends out a new or replacement card via post, then a criminal may be able to intercept the package or steal it from the account holder’s mailbox. This is why most card issuers will use unmarked letters and packaging when sending cards."}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"4Ubbfk9fmCd4n530mvIG7v","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-20T23:46:18.261Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-20T23:46:18.261Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"How to identify credit card fraud"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"7sEkK9EwYGPAObzoib70Dv","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-20T23:46:05.774Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-20T23:48:36.792Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Credit card fraud is the most common type of identity theft.
