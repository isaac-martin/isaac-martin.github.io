Transferring balances from high-interest accounts to one with a lower rate of interest can reduce the overall cost of borrowing and help you clear your debt faster. \n\nConsolidating multiple debts also gives you a more manageable repayment plan. This means you are less likely to miss or be late with payments, helping you avoid penalty fees.

Customers will not be subject to any interest throughout the promotional period, which could be as long as three years. \n\nRepayments made during this time will go entirely towards clearing the credit card principal. This means you can repay your debt faster with zero interest, as long as you clear your balance within the interest-free period. Paying more than the minimum amount will help you achieve this.

Take all fees into account when choosing a balance transfer credit card and check that you can repay your balance within the promotional period.\n\nMany credit card issuers require that you transfer 90-95% of the credit limit on your existing card. This is to ensure you don’t have multiple debts on other accounts, which could result in missed payments.

Upon acceptance, you will usually have 60 days to transfer your debts. Failure to do so can result in the issuer withdrawing promotional terms. \n\nTo secure the most competitive borrowing terms, you should ensure you have the best possible credit score.
