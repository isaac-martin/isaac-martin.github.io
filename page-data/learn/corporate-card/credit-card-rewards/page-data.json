Here are some of the most common ways corporate credit card customers can get more out of their spending:\n\n### Redeemable points\nMost [corporate credit cards with rewards](https://brex.com/rewards/) give their customers a certain number of points per dollar spent on the card. These can be redeemed for specific products or services, either with participating retailers or via the card issuer’s online store. Cardholders may also redeem these points as cash or gift cards, depending on the terms of the issuer. \n\nBy accumulating points, corporate credit card customers can get perks for their day-to-day spending. This can make it easier for them to make purchases, reward their employees, or entertain clients. \n\n### Miles and travel rewards\nTravel is critical for many companies. That’s why some corporate [credit cards reward customers with miles](https://brex.com/travel/), which can be redeemed for airline tickets. The value of these miles will vary depending on the frequent flier program. \n\nSome issuers may also offer point multipliers which pay higher rewards on travel purchases, such as flights, accommodation, and transfers.\n\n### Cash rewards\nCorporate credit card customers can also earn monetary rewards. These can be redeemed at specific increments or for a set minimum amount. \n\nDespite their name, customers won’t necessarily receive such rewards in cash. They may be paid as credit into the account, made as a deposit, or sent as a check. Some issuers will also allow you to redeem cash rewards as gift cards with their partner merchants. Doing so can sometimes be more valuable, with merchants giving you a certain percentage off orders. \n\n### Exclusive discounts with partners\nThe best credit card rewards are available alongside exclusive discounts with participating retailers. These can give customers money off the products and services they need to operate and expand their business. \n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"1UoWvb2CDGTmrH0Nkn2efV","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-11T00:25:04.302Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-11T00:25:04.302Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Things to consider with credit card rewards"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"2zayuh62LoPknWXG1IZ3bk","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-11T00:31:19.828Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-11T00:31:19.828Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Even the most rewarding credit cards can come with terms and conditions that limit the value of reward programs.
