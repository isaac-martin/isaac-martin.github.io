The difference is that charge cards require full payment at the end of each billing cycle. Unlike a credit card where you can carry a balance forward, charge card customers must clear their entire balance each month or risk facing fines and the closure of their account. \n\nAs there is no revolving balance on charge cards, customers pay no interest. Other advantages can include no preset spending limit, along with standard benefits such as fraud protection and reward programs. \n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"5uTkPaHuRHeWWAuMaKihT7","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-01-09T15:16:08.896Z","updatedAt":"2020-01-09T15:16:08.896Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"The advantages of charge cards"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"2w3aSemYVdv67EqRkEm5B8","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-01-09T15:16:48.211Z","updatedAt":"2020-01-09T15:16:48.211Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"The main distinction between charge and credit cards is the need to repay charge cards in full each billing cycle. This makes them ideal for customers who wish to avoid accruing credit card debt. It can encourage good financial disciplines, reduce overspending and make money management simpler. If you do want some added flexibility, some charge cards come with pay-over-time features. \n\nSome issuers may also offer charge cards with no preset spending limit. This can make it easier to fund major investments or big-ticket items without worrying about exceeding a credit limit. Your issuer is not giving you access to limitless funds though, as many charge card limits adjust according to factors such as your payment history and spending behaviour.\n\nAnother perk of charge cards is that they tend to incentivize spending with lucrative reward programs. Reward points are typically redeemable on travel, dining and purchases with partner merchants. Other benefits can include access to exclusive discounts and ticket sales, as well as protection such as [extended warranties](https://brex.com/learn/corporate-card/what-is-extended-warranty/) and travel accident and luggage insurance.

However, many issuers waive this for the first year, and the cost can often be offset by the rewards and benefits on offer. \n\nYou can also be subject to late fees if you fail to pay off your full balance on time or miss a payment altogether. The cost of late fees vary by issuer, but they tend to increase if you make multiple delinquent payments. Failure to repay the full amount on your charge card can also result in damage to your credit score and your issuer closing your account.\n"}}],"urlPath":"how-do-charge-holds-work","category":"corporate-card","thumbnailImage":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"3naTlnnuMMhgYmYe3L1W6S","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2020-01-09T15:21:52.667Z","updatedAt":"2020-01-09T15:21:52.667Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Thumbnail-charge-card","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lrdkz6qgi9tt/3naTlnnuMMhgYmYe3L1W6S/8fc6b4b42db54669cf4bb36597ea5d1b/Thumbnail-charge-card.png","details":{"size":61417,"image":{"width":273,"height":273}},"fileName":"Thumbnail-charge-card.png","contentType":"image/png"}}}}}}}
