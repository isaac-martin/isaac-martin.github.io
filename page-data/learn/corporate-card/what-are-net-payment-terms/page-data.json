Delinquent payments from customers and slow periods can drastically reduce a company’s cash flow. As a result, they can lack the funds required to purchase the inventory and supplies they need. \n\nThankfully, trade credit, or ‘net terms’, gives businesses a flexible financing option when they are short on cash. Vendors and suppliers will front businesses with vital inventory and defer payment for a set period. This way, small businesses don’t need to delay essential inventory purchases, while B2B merchants can close more deals in an increasingly competitive market.

Credit issuers will require applicants to meet strict criteria and will run checks on the owner’s personal credit score.\n\nBusinesses may also seek funding from other sources because of the need to provide collateral or complete a lengthy application process.\n\nNet terms offer a simpler alternative. Suppliers can extend credit to businesses following a short trade credit application process. This means companies can get the goods they need to operate when they need them, and can wait for a certain period before payment becomes due. \n\nOffering net terms can also be beneficial for suppliers. It can give them a competitive edge to secure new clients, build relationships, and grow business with SMBs that find it difficult to fund their purchases by other means.

However, the net terms can vary depending on the seller and industry.

It’s important that businesses check the payment terms of a trade credit agreement and ensure that this allows them enough time to accrue the funds for full payment. \n\nTo encourage early payment, many vendors offer discounts to businesses that settle their invoices before the due date. These are often a small percentage deduction off the full amount due and can end up saving businesses a significant amount in the long term.

It can make it challenging to secure relationships with suppliers in the future. Major credit bureaus, including Dun & Bradstreet, Experian, and Equifax, all take a business’ payment history into account when calculating their b[usiness credit score](https://brex.com/learn/loans-credit-scores/what-is-business-credit-score/). \n\nDelinquent payments can lead to a lower score, representing a higher financial risk. A lower business credit score can also make it more challenging to borrow from credit providers.\n\nBusinesses should ensure they are ordering efficiently from suppliers to take full advantage of net terms.
