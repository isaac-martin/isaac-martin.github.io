Each cardholder may also have a custom rule set. For example, senior managers may have higher limits than sales staff to allow for expenses such as business travel.\n\nAll businesses should outline clear policies when issuing corporate credit cards for employees. This allows each cardholder to fully understand the rules and regulations, liability, credit limits, and expense procedures. \n\nA corporate credit card policy should inform employees how they are expected to use their corporate credit cards, as well as the consequences if they breach the terms of use. These policies will vary by business.\n\n### Eligibility of employees\n\nOne of the first sections of a corporate credit card policy should outline which employees are eligible to become authorized cardholders. It should also provide details on how employees can be approved for a card. They should know whether they are required to apply themselves or if the company will issue one directly to them. \n\n### Authorized Usage\n\nCorporate credit cards should fund approved businesses expenses only. Employees, therefore, need to understand what counts as an allowable expense and which charges are prohibited. (You probably don’t want every employee automatically upgrading their flights to first class if they don’t need it.)\n\n### Liability\n\nLiability for the repayment of corporate credit card balances can lie with the company or be shared with cardholders. Joint liability requires employees to make payments for their transactions and receive reimbursement through expense reports. This can keep employees accountable for their purchases.\n\nRegardless of liability, the policy should include information on who is responsible for repayments and replacement of lost cards, along with the company’s right to suspend and cancel individual cards at any time. \n\n### Expense reporting procedure\n\nEmployees will need to know how to submit expense reports to receive repayment if they have joint liability for payments on their corporate credit cards. The policy should inform them of the required receipts, as well as the monthly dates for expense report submittal, approval, and reimbursement. \n\n### Spending limits\n\nBusinesses should set out their spending limits, including any frequency limits or restrictions on certain expense categories like travel and entertainment. The policy should also explain if employees are subject to different spending limits on their corporate credit cards."}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"3RtF98BhO8xYBsujGkHJV0","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-21T00:51:03.458Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-21T00:51:03.458Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Consequences for violations"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"sviU0YlpWiPQUEhVPNqyO","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-21T00:51:18.294Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-21T00:51:18.294Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Unfortunately, employee misuse of credit card funds does happen.
