This may be a flat fee per cash advance transaction, or it may be a percentage of the total amount you withdraw. These fees can be as high as 5%.\n\n\n- __Interest:__ While all credit card transactions are subject to APR, interest is often significantly higher for cash advances. There is also no grace period as there is with purchases. This means interest on your cash advance can start accruing from the moment you make the withdrawal.

This will reduce interest and transaction fees. You should also consider whether the purchase is necessary and worth the costs.\n- __Ask to borrow money:__ If you need cash and don’t have the funds in your bank account, it’s worth asking friends, family or colleagues to lend it to you. It may be an awkward situation, but it can save you money. \n- __Set up alerts on your bank account:__ Some people use credit card cash advances because they don’t have enough funds in their bank account. If this is the case, start monitoring your balance more closely to avoid unexpectedly running low. Many banks offer text and email alerts to notify you when your balance dips below a certain amount.\n- __Put money aside for emergencies:__ Unexpected expenses can result in you relying more on your credit card. When your finances are looking healthy, put some funds aside so you won’t have to use cash advances to pay for nasty surprises.\n- __Make purchases with petty cash:__ When paying for business expenses with a small business or corporate credit card, never be tempted to withdraw cash. This could violate your company’s policy and may result in you having to cover the fees. Instead, if you need paper money, request to take it from petty cash and fill out an expense
