You may have ordered something online, and when it arrived, it was faulty, damaged, or didn’t meet your expectations. Or maybe you realized you no longer want or need the item when you get home from the store. \n\nMost retailers make the credit card refund process straightforward. You will need the receipt and the credit card used to make the original purchase. If you do not have this credit card available, some merchants may be able to obtain the details from the receipt. They may also be willing to offer you store credit or a gift card for the value of the purchase.\n\nThe retailer will not be able to give you cash or make the refund to a different credit or debit card. When you purchase something with your credit card, the issuer makes the payment to the retailer on your behalf. You do not pay the retailer directly and are not billed by your credit card issuer for the transaction until a later date.\n\nCredit card refunds are not the same as billing disputes. Refunds involve returning items to the retailer to have the money credited back into your account. Billing disputes cover [fraudulent activity](https://brex.com/learn/fraud-security/what-is-credit-card-fraud/)on your account, charges for purchases you never received, errors in the amount you paid, or other erroneous activity. For billing disputes, contact your credit card issuer so they can demand a chargeback from the merchant. \n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"3BWk3ut6uAThbGgyG55xZf","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-22T20:49:17.731Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-22T20:49:17.731Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"How long will the refund take?"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"53p7vPyIgBjs5j3frvZPyx","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-22T20:49:47.002Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-22T20:49:47.002Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"The return method and retailer’s policies affect how long it takes for you to receive a credit card refund.

You may have to wait even longer if you are returning the item by mail due to the added shipping time.  \n\nCredit card refunds can take longer than cash or debit card refunds, but they offer you greater [protection](https://brex.com/learn/fraud-security/credit-card-protection/) against fraudulent and disputed charges. Other benefits include price protection, which ensures you always get the best price on your purchase, as well as return protection.
