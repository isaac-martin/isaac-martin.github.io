It is 81% more likely than card-present fraud. There are several methods they use to do this, including [phishing scams](https://brex.com/learn/fraud-security/what-is-phishing-scam/) and [malware](https://brex.com/learn/fraud-security/what-is-malware/). They can also use skimmer devices, which they fit to ATMs and card readers to collect information from the card’s magnetic strip.\n\nThe CVV code gives you additional protection, as the magnetic strip does not store this number. Industry regulations also prohibit the storage of CVV numbers on merchant websites.

Some fraudsters will be able to collect your CVV number using malware. Even if they are unable to obtain this code, they may still be able to use your information to make card-not-present transactions, as some merchant websites do not require a CVV.  \n\nAsk if your issuer offers a [virtual card](https://brex.com/learn/fraud-security/how-virtual-credit-card-works/) service. These electronic cards randomly generate temporary details for you to input at the online checkout. They are linked to your credit account, and purchases will appear on your statement as normal. As the information is only valid for one transaction, they are useless to fraudsters.\n\nWhen shopping online, look for “https://” at the start of the website’s URL or a padlock icon near the top of the browser. These are signs that a site is secure. Avoid using websites that do not request CVVs and utilize verified payment gateways, like Verified by Visa, where possible.\n\nYou can reduce your risk of falling victim to phishing scams by exercising caution with unsolicited emails or calls. Never provide your card details unless you can verify the request is from a trusted source.\n\nIt’s a good idea to use strong passwords that are unique to each site and regularly update these. Do not save your details on a website, especially if you are accessing it through a device that is not private. Also, consider using VPN technology to encrypt your data when connecting to public Wi-Fi.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"3gaAECK5XO14Y2SPsNvuf3","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-12-03T22:09:41.123Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-03T22:09:41.123Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"fourStepTile"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"articleLinks":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"5zCWLcJlHPTE4IGc8sU7Vs","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-22T23:25:00.398Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-22T23:25:00.398Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"articleHeader"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"category":"corporate-card","thumbnailImage":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"5JemQkXNqA7Rp20By1cbbQ","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2019-10-22T23:24:51.975Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-22T23:24:51.975Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Thumbnail-credit-residual-interest","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lrdkz6qgi9tt/5JemQkXNqA7Rp20By1cbbQ/e4cecfc59927a6bff76cf8a1aceafcc8/Thumbnail-credit-residual-interest.png","details":{"size":61650,"image":{"width":273,"height":273}},"fileName":"Thumbnail-credit-residual-interest.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"urlPath":"what-is-residual-interest","title":"What
