A lower score can also result in less competitive borrowing terms, such as higher interest rates and lower credit limits.\n\n### How long does a credit administrative hold last?\n\nIf a hold is in place due to an exceeded credit limit, this will last until payment has been made to bring the account balance under the limit again. In the case of late payments, the hold will be in effect until the account holder has made several on-time payments to demonstrate that they are a responsible borrower. For regular late payments, the issuer could cancel your card. \n\nTo avoid the risk of facing an administrative hold, consider using banking alerts.

Some issuers may divide the annual fee into monthly charges. \n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"5pCQN7IuN2BwAYRlsSHbOH","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-11-18T20:16:30.740Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-18T20:16:30.740Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"What do you get in return for annual credit card fees?"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"16uUNoqB9a15AOjiUXYhzb","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-11-18T20:17:04.225Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-18T20:17:14.718Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"Many no annual fee credit cards offer rewards to their customers.

It’s important to understand how residual interest works to avoid any unexpected charges. \n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"2VFaXHAuCOIRsQgAVFqzvD","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-22T23:21:55.605Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-22T23:21:55.605Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionTitle"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"How residual interest can affect you"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"lrdkz6qgi9tt"}},"id":"5d2588cSUsf20xDbcNmiru","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-10-22T23:22:21.174Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-22T23:22:21.174Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"bodyText"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"text":"You may have made a payment to your issuer for the amount shown as ‘balance due’ on your latest statement, but this will not include residual interest.

These grace periods only apply to new purchases and for customers who clear their balance in full each month.

Even if the credit card has an annual fee, the high-value rewards can often make them worthwhile. Some issuers may also issue additional benefits like travel credits or perks that can outweigh the value of the annual fee.\n\nYou should always assess whether you can meet the bonus requirements without overstretching yourself. Consider other options if you don’t have enough planned spending to meet the minimum spending threshold. Reward cards with lower spending requirements or without sign-up bonuses may be more suitable for your needs.\n\nBy spending more to meet the bonus threshold, you may be unable to clear your balance in full each month. The interest this incurs will significantly reduce the value of the sign-up bonus and can end up canceling out the value of the rewards you earn.\n\nYou should also do plenty of research to understand the value of the bonus on the sign-up offer. Reward points can fluctuate in value between card issuers and even change over time. Check that your credit card rewards remain competitive once the sign-up bonus ends and shop around to find the best deal.\n\nRead the terms and conditions of the card to ensure you qualify. Many issuers will not allow you to redeem sign-up bonuses if you already have another account with them. Some companies limit their bonuses to one per lifetime, including on personal and [small business cards](https://brex.com/learn/corporate-card/corporate-vs-business-credit-card/).\n\nThe terms will also outline which transactions count towards the minimum spending threshold.

Each cardholder may also have a custom rule set. For example, senior managers may have higher limits than sales staff to allow for expenses such as business travel.\n\nAll businesses should outline clear policies when issuing corporate credit cards for employees. This allows each cardholder to fully understand the rules and regulations, liability, credit limits, and expense procedures. \n\nA corporate credit card policy should inform employees how they are expected to use their corporate credit cards, as well as the consequences if they breach the terms of use. These policies will vary by business.\n\n### Eligibility of employees\n\nOne of the first sections of a corporate credit card policy should outline which employees are eligible to become authorized cardholders. It should also provide details on how employees can be approved for a card. They should know whether they are required to apply themselves or if the company will issue one directly to them. \n\n### Authorized Usage\n\nCorporate credit cards should fund approved businesses expenses only. Employees, therefore, need to understand what counts as an allowable expense and which charges are prohibited. (You probably don’t want every employee automatically upgrading their flights to first class if they don’t need it.)\n\n### Liability\n\nLiability for the repayment of corporate credit card balances can lie with the company or be shared with cardholders. Joint liability requires employees to make payments for their transactions and receive reimbursement through expense reports. This can keep employees accountable for their purchases.\n\nRegardless of liability, the policy should include information on who is responsible for repayments and replacement of lost cards, along with the company’s right to suspend and cancel individual cards at any time. \n\n### Expense reporting procedure\n\nEmployees will need to know how to submit expense reports to receive repayment if they have joint liability for payments on their corporate credit cards. The policy should inform them of the required receipts, as well as the monthly dates for expense report submittal, approval, and reimbursement. \n\n### Spending limits\n\nBusinesses should set out their spending limits, including any frequency limits or restrictions on certain expense categories like travel and entertainment.

Remember that issuers can close your account due to inactivity, so you may need to make small purchases every now and again.\n\nJoint credit cardholders should close their account if they are separating or have serious disagreements about its management.

These can be redeemed for specific products or services, either with participating retailers or via the card issuer’s online store. Cardholders may also redeem these points as cash or gift cards, depending on the terms of the issuer. \n\nBy accumulating points, corporate credit card customers can get perks for their day-to-day spending. This can make it easier for them to make purchases, reward their employees, or entertain clients. \n\n### Miles and travel rewards\nTravel is critical for many companies. That’s why some corporate [credit cards reward customers with miles](https://brex.com/travel/), which can be redeemed for airline tickets. The value of these miles will vary depending on the frequent flier program. \n\nSome issuers may also offer point multipliers which pay higher rewards on travel purchases, such as flights, accommodation, and transfers.\n\n### Cash rewards\nCorporate credit card customers can also earn monetary rewards. These can be redeemed at specific increments or for a set minimum amount. \n\nDespite their name, customers won’t necessarily receive such rewards in cash. They may be paid as credit into the account, made as a deposit, or sent as a check. Some issuers will also allow you to redeem cash rewards as gift cards with their partner merchants. Doing so can sometimes be more valuable, with merchants giving you a certain percentage off orders. \n\n### Exclusive discounts with partners\nThe best credit card rewards are available alongside exclusive discounts with participating retailers.
