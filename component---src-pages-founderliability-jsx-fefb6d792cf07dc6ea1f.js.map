However, sometimes personal guarantees\n        do not only affect your long term credit, but your ability to get credit\n        at all.\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"basic-text\">\n        Take Victor Santos for example, who moved to the United States from\n        Brazil at a young age. As an immigrant with no credit score and parents\n        who could not guarantee his credit, Victor couldn’t find a bank that\n        would approve a small business card without requiring a security\n        deposit.\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"basic-text\">\n        As Victor puts it: “Picture yourself in my position—I was very young, in\n        a different country, trying to start a business and could not get\n        approved for a card like everybody else. Why? Because I did not have a\n        personal credit score a bank could look at.”\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"basic-text\">\n        Not qualifying for a credit card without putting down a substantial\n        security deposit posed a major challenge for Victor. He needed a card to\n        pay for the software, servers, and computing power startups need to run\n        their business. Without a credit card, there was simply no way he’d be\n        able to get his business off the ground and eventually scale.\n      </div>\n    </SectionSideComponent>\n    <div className=\"basic-vertical-divider\" />\n    <SectionSideComponent>\n      <div className=\"basic-title\">\n        A RISK FOUNDERS DON’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"basic-text\">\n        As we’ve seen, startup founders are assuming a high degree of risk when\n        they launch their startups. Making matters worse, traditional banking,\n        and lending institutions have created additional hurdles for startup\n        founders to gain access to capital.\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"basic-text\">\n        But it doesn’t have to be this way. Brex is leveling the playing field\n        by creating the first corporate card for startups.

By\n        rebuilding the technology from scratch, they’ve reimagined underwriting\n        so it doesn’t require personal guarantees. Brex assesses companies based\n        on factors that matter – like cash in the bank and activity in the\n        business – and can avoid using the outdated, non-transparent, and\n        potentially biased personal guaranteed approach.\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"basic-text\">\n        In doing so, Brex ensures founders and their credit scores are not\n        exposed to added risk at one of the riskiest junctures in their\n        lives—starting a company. The new face of credit ensures that founders\n        have access to capital at the most crucial time, without the hidden\n        clauses.\n      </div>\n    </SectionSideComponent>\n  </SectionComponent>\n);\n\nexport default EndOfPaper;\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nimport FounderIntro from \"components/founder-liability/founder-intro.jsx\";\nimport BeginningOfPaper from \"components/founder-liability/beginning-of-paper.jsx\";\nimport SecondPart from \"components/founder-liability/second-part.jsx\";\nimport ThirdPart from \"components/founder-liability/third-part.jsx\";\nimport FourthPart from \"components/founder-liability/fourth-part.jsx\";\nimport FifthPart from \"components/founder-liability/fifth-part.jsx\";\nimport EndOfPaper from \"components/founder-liability/end-of-paper.jsx\";\nimport Layout from \"components/layout\";\n\nconst FounderLiabilityPage = ({ location }) => (\n  <Layout location={location}>\n    <FounderIntro />\n    <div className=\"basic-section-divider\" />\n    <BeginningOfPaper />\n    <div className=\"basic-section-divider\" />\n    <SecondPart />\n    <div className=\"basic-section-divider\" />\n    <ThirdPart />\n    <div className=\"basic-section-divider\" />\n    <FourthPart />\n    <div className=\"basic-section-divider\" />\n    <FifthPart />\n    <div className=\"basic-section-divider\" />\n    <EndOfPaper />\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default FounderLiabilityPage;\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/important-numbers-850cbb977e12a19daafe3dac04e44d00.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/terms-and-conditions-39bdfcc3c6a14fd792f1b7cfc2210306.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
