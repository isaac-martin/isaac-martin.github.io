Took six weeks to kind of fully bake.\",\n  },\n\n  {\n    \"Scott Orn\":\n      \"But so everything is like super fresh in my head.

You know, there's not many people, you guys, Michael Senet, Healy Jones, who's also a former investment banker and venture capitalist who works at Kruze.

So the first part of the process is... it's almost like dating or finding your significant other, you know, like someone's been looking at your profile... it's like, I don't know, the analogy of like Tinder. Someone's looking at your profile, they know who you are, you go on the first date, sometimes it's really informal, and all of a sudden you start getting an indication that this company wants to buy my company. Holy cow, this is amazing.\",\n  },\n\n  {\n    \"Scott Orn\":\n      \"And usually it's very kind of informal, very verbal, but then it gets serious. And often when you get that letter of intent, it becomes a very serious thing. And, and the CEO and the whole management team's mind shifts from like, \\\"Oh my God, this is a life changing moment for both me, it's a potentially career making moment for my venture capitalist because this is why they invested in the company, and I better not screw this up.\\\" And that's where like the lizard brain kicks in a little bit, and you have to be really careful not to mess things up. And you start going into, \\\"What do I need to do to make this acquisition work?\\\"\",\n  },\n\n  {\n    \"Chris R\": \"And so what would those things be?\",\n  },\n\n  {\n    \"Scott Orn\":\n      \"Yeah. So my favorite moment at Kruze when we bring a company on, we actually do a full compliance and financial checkup, and make sure we go back and fix a lot of stuff.\",\n  },\n\n  {\n    \"Scott Orn\":\n      \"So the company is always in compliance, their financials are always up to date.

Michael, you've probably experienced this in banking, the scramble to get everything put together. Our companies don't have to do that. And my favorite moment of working with a client often is when they call me and tell me they have a letter of intent, I say, \\\"You're good. Everything's ready. You don't have to stress. It's going to be fine.\\\"\",\n  },\n\n  {\n    \"Michael Tannenbaum\":\n      'Yeah. I mean, when we were... Not for a merger, but when we had to do our first Series B here, Enrique told me, and I had to pull those... You know, I used to say in banking, \"All nighters keep you fresh.\" They do. I like an all nighter every once in a while to keep me fresh. I do. And I was very fresh. I went all night working with Enrique and then we, and then it was kind of a quick story, but we put that together because, you know, capital raising or M&As is the only thing that really keeps you up.',\n  },\n\n  {\n    \"Scott Orn\": \"And they're both super similar. It's the same thing.\",\n  },\n\n  {\n    \"Michael Tannenbaum\":\n      'We put it all together. Then we went down to Andreessen Horowitz the next morning, we ended up going a different route, but we went there, there was fresh coffee, pastries, everything was calm.

Like sometimes you find startups want to go a little bit cheap on their lawyers, but actually finding a good lawyer who has a lot of deal experience, and can be there for you in these kind of times, actually it's cheaper.

There's just so many nitty-gritty things that a good lawyer is going to do. And they'll also go to bat for you. The opposing counsel often is representing a big acquirer over and over again. So they're always trying to demonstrate their value and make sure they don't lose that client. So they're sometimes like a pit bull. They really come after you. So having a good lawyer to kind of fend that off, look out for your best interests. Also looking out for your best interest as a founder. Sometimes you know the venture capitalists care about the economic return, which is what is their job so they should, but like a founder cares about like what they're going to be working on after. How long is their lock up, all that kind of stuff.

I think generally speaking, it helps just to have optionality. Like a founder, if you don't need to be tied down, why would you want to be?

But if you start hiding the ball on financial performance, that's indication that you're not trustworthy enough, and they don't want to bet on you.
